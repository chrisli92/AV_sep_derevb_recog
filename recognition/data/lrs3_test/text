rev1-0Fi83BHQsMA-00002 we really don't walk anymore
rev1-0Fi83BHQsMA-00004 at some point i'm going to get out
rev1-0Fi83BHQsMA-00005 when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
rev1-0Fi83BHQsMA-00006 we'd love to help
rev1-0QVXdEOiCw8-00001 i wasn't very good at reading things
rev1-0VJqrlH9cdI-00001 and he said on the spot absolutely yes
rev1-0VJqrlH9cdI-00002 he was smiling and we said go
rev1-0ZfSOArXbGQ-00001 we said yes
rev1-0ZfSOArXbGQ-00002 we were so excited
rev1-0ZfSOArXbGQ-00003 and so one of the major challenges of our project really is to find photographs that were taken before something
rev1-0gks6ceq4eQ-00002 not what is it
rev1-0gks6ceq4eQ-00005 predictions are the basis of every experience that you have
rev1-0gks6ceq4eQ-00006 they are the basis of every action that you take
rev1-0gks6ceq4eQ-00007 it's using past experience based on similar situations to try to make meaning
rev1-0gks6ceq4eQ-00008 and so how does your brain give you that detail
rev1-0gks6ceq4eQ-00009 well that's what predictions are
rev1-0gks6ceq4eQ-00010 i'm totally serious
rev1-0gks6ceq4eQ-00013 i know i have
rev1-0gks6ceq4eQ-00015 so when you're born you can make feelings like calmness and
rev1-0iIh5YYDR2o-00001 i'm not a social problem guy
rev1-18uDutylDa4-00001 i feel guilty sometimes
rev1-18uDutylDa4-00002 so i'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone
rev1-18uDutylDa4-00004 boy it matters a lot
rev1-18uDutylDa4-00007 what do you mean
rev1-18uDutylDa4-00009 your job needs to be challenging
rev1-18uDutylDa4-00010 he's a great guy
rev1-18uDutylDa4-00011 you want to work for him
rev1-1K5SycZjGhI-00001 blocks have names
rev1-1L6lSFiV4xo-00002 you just have to find another term and look that up
rev1-1L6lSFiV4xo-00003 i do like magic
rev1-1PNX6MSdVsk-00001 i don't have an overview
rev1-1PNX6MSdVsk-00005 more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
rev1-1PNX6MSdVsk-00007 trust is the response
rev1-1PNX6MSdVsk-00009 we can do it two people together trying to improve trust
rev1-1PNX6MSdVsk-00010 because it's given by other people
rev1-1PNX6MSdVsk-00011 let me give you a simple commercial example
rev1-1US4jjWtua8-00001 we're going to eat these cows
rev1-1US4jjWtua8-00002 they're not being shipped up here
rev1-1US4jjWtua8-00004 it's not optional
rev1-1US4jjWtua8-00005 it's not a luxury
rev1-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00001 we've done the research
rev1-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00004 she had to impersonate a man
rev1-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00005 mortality is not going down it's going up
rev1-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00006 and not enough is being done about this
rev1-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00007 it told us about hormone replacement therapy
rev1-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00011 women are worth it
rev1-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00013 so what do you think happens to these gals
rev1-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00014 they're often not recognized sent home
rev1-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00015 i'm not sure what it was
rev1-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00017 well once again women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem
rev1-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00020 and we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years
rev1-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00021 and in fact it probably won't
rev1-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00022 so we have these feast and famine cycles
rev1-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00023 so thank you for your attention
rev1-27lMmdmySb8-00001 everybody focuses on the things that kill us and that's what i was focusing on
rev1-27lMmdmySb8-00002 and they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants
rev1-27lMmdmySb8-00005 actually studied hormones
rev1-27lMmdmySb8-00006 we can't see it most of the time
rev1-27lMmdmySb8-00008 and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases
rev1-2SlBiFZ85d0-00002 i have three sons so i see how they fight
rev1-2SlBiFZ85d0-00003 we're not just part of the same species
rev1-2SlBiFZ85d0-00004 we're part of the same family
rev1-2SlBiFZ85d0-00006 and i won't name names but you know who you are
rev1-2SlBiFZ85d0-00008 so that's what i'm doing
rev1-2UStOghblfE-00001 why are we embedded in social networks
rev1-2UStOghblfE-00002 i mean how do they form
rev1-2UStOghblfE-00003 how do they operate
rev1-2UStOghblfE-00004 how far do they reach
rev1-2UStOghblfE-00005 and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother
rev1-3A1LvXRnpVg-00001 give me input
rev1-3OgsRa7VDtI-00001 they can't get what they need when they need it
rev1-3OgsRa7VDtI-00003 that's the status quo today
rev1-3OgsRa7VDtI-00004 gov just six people
rev1-3OgsRa7VDtI-00008 yes it's hard
rev1-3nSEitPb7BU-00001 but it wasn't just individuals
rev1-3r1IPsldbBg-00002 well there's a self fulfilling prophecy
rev1-3r1IPsldbBg-00003 we shouldn't be nationalistic
rev1-3uSQlcGCHUU-00001 this economy won't work and thomas jefferson saying the people won't trust that
rev1-3uSQlcGCHUU-00006 but that system has tons of problems
rev1-3uSQlcGCHUU-00008 wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive
rev1-3uSQlcGCHUU-00011 but that is not the case at all
rev1-3uSQlcGCHUU-00012 or do you think the government should redistribute
rev1-3uSQlcGCHUU-00014 and nothing happened at all
rev1-3uSQlcGCHUU-00015 so i'm in the media
rev1-3uSQlcGCHUU-00016 they don't represent what our views are
rev1-3uSQlcGCHUU-00017 we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton
rev1-3vfuCPFb8wk-00001 but it's more complicated
rev1-3zqZPujAPuc-00001 so no more missing guys
rev1-48xS00Iy0ac-00002 buildings can be like people
rev1-48xS00Iy0ac-00003 their faces broadcast their experience
rev1-4AYE3w5TWHs-00004 and then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues
rev1-4AYE3w5TWHs-00005 so just like with a bike we don't talk about it
rev1-4AYE3w5TWHs-00006 you can try it
rev1-4ErEBkjS3PY-00001 i'm a professor and we're passionate about education
rev1-4Q2aznfmcYU-00001 now don't get me wrong
rev1-4Q2aznfmcYU-00002 of course they would
rev1-4n8qT0vQbWk-00001 but this is what i heard from a lot of outraged people
rev1-4n8qT0vQbWk-00003 we have to decide what it means
rev1-4v4XxlfVk3o-00001 this is completely bizarre
rev1-55yGmKc6WfE-00001 they're looking and looking and finding love
rev1-5Knz100ldLM-00001 we can open up city hall
rev1-5P04stEjJ9E-00003 i'm not a military brat
rev1-5P04stEjJ9E-00004 they signed up because they wanted some form of revenge
rev1-5P04stEjJ9E-00005 one was to be a soldier
rev1-5P04stEjJ9E-00006 the other was to be a baseball player
rev1-5Yj3nGv0kn8-00001 are you losing your mind
rev1-5Yj3nGv0kn8-00002 so let's watch what happens
rev1-5b5BDoddOLA-00001 so that was easy
rev1-5b5BDoddOLA-00002 we weren't considered the real thing
rev1-5b5BDoddOLA-00004 and the way to do it is through the bloodstream
rev1-5ifMRNag2XU-00001 i want to be the center of attention
rev1-5riPKdpuoiI-00002 did you find the gold
rev1-62cNtvx6P8E-00001 i could make that decision
rev1-66koScWSHBU-00001 and the problem that we're solving is what are those things
rev1-66koScWSHBU-00003 they won the game
rev1-66koScWSHBU-00005 so bear with me
rev1-66koScWSHBU-00006 thank you very much
rev1-6OaIdwUdSxE-00003 make me laugh
rev1-6Waurx8eS1o-00001 how can somebody like that make you feel smart
rev1-6Waurx8eS1o-00003 he made me feel smart
rev1-6Waurx8eS1o-00008 you saw him act
rev1-6kHSuYwt0qs-00002 we don't use audio we don't use video
rev1-6ra1MIKlYB0-00002 how are you
rev1-6wNif5SlN08-00001 the boys reminded me of home
rev1-6wNif5SlN08-00005 i didn't want to
rev1-6wNif5SlN08-00007 i said in arabic
rev1-6wNif5SlN08-00010 after college i desperately needed to find a place to call home
rev1-6wNif5SlN08-00011 1 percent who get to do that
rev1-6wNif5SlN08-00012 they had hit the jackpot
rev1-6wNif5SlN08-00013 life is good
rev1-6wNif5SlN08-00014 it wasn't like them to miss practice
rev1-7OMLSs8t1ng-00001 i do understand it
rev1-7OMLSs8t1ng-00002 doesn't happen very much
rev1-7OMLSs8t1ng-00007 i don't know
rev1-7OMLSs8t1ng-00010 you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases
rev1-7OMLSs8t1ng-00012 what about polio
rev1-7OMLSs8t1ng-00013 let's have that
rev1-7OMLSs8t1ng-00014 no one's ever said that before
rev1-7OMLSs8t1ng-00017 we don't trust the man
rev1-7OMLSs8t1ng-00018 it has to stop
rev1-7OMLSs8t1ng-00019 it's a debate about words about metaphors
rev1-7ZymFMmpOa0-00002 but in fact they found something very surprising
rev1-7ZymFMmpOa0-00005 we used to have a manufacturing economy which was about building goods and products and now we have a service
rev1-7ZymFMmpOa0-00006 but that really isn't true anymore
rev1-7ZymFMmpOa0-00007 you would be issuing orders from above
rev1-7ZymFMmpOa0-00009 this is a real mystery
rev1-7ZymFMmpOa0-00011 and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
rev1-7gXq1ml6B1E-00001 it's natural connective tissue
rev1-7gkdzkVbuVA-00001 originally the sample was aged 18 to 94
rev1-7gkdzkVbuVA-00003 how sad are you right now
rev1-7gkdzkVbuVA-00004 how frustrated are you right now
rev1-7gkdzkVbuVA-00005 we take less notice of trivial matters
rev1-7hQ0rgVfsP8-00001 well i was surprised
rev1-7hQ0rgVfsP8-00002 i did not know this
rev1-7kkRkhAXZGg-00003 now in all seriousness movies are actually really important
rev1-7kkRkhAXZGg-00004 storytelling is so important
rev1-7kkRkhAXZGg-00006 stories are amazing
rev1-7kkRkhAXZGg-00007 but what does
rev1-7kkRkhAXZGg-00010 what would happen
rev1-7nZqiPLCvM4-00001 you don't do much editing
rev1-7qT3RpaBlJo-00001 it is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least
rev1-7qT3RpaBlJo-00002 one you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is
rev1-7uN4I1wEOXE-00001 i have to take a year off
rev1-81Ub0SMxZQo-00001 i'm talking about teachers
rev1-81Ub0SMxZQo-00002 how would i know what i was doing differently
rev1-81Ub0SMxZQo-00003 so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
rev1-87AEeLpodnE-00001 they supported me all the way through it
rev1-87AEeLpodnE-00002 something was wrong
rev1-87AEeLpodnE-00004 has it gotten better
rev1-87AEeLpodnE-00005 that's something we ought to celebrate
rev1-87AEeLpodnE-00008 irreconcilable differences right
rev1-87AEeLpodnE-00010 we're blessed with people who listen to us
rev1-8GQZuzIdeQQ-00001 it wasn't who i was
rev1-8GQZuzIdeQQ-00004 here's where i stand
rev1-8HfoKd873HY-00001 i tried everything
rev1-8K9Gg164Bsw-00001 what a contradiction
rev1-8UhqkX2VAmo-00001 otherwise millions more will die
rev1-8VwTZFYSfvw-00001 i don't even know if it's a real job title to be honest
rev1-8VwTZFYSfvw-00002 it was the coldest i've ever been
rev1-8Z24LCysq3A-00001 one thousand eight hundred and thirty six people died
rev1-8iSpNVj5KMw-00001 he got part time i
rev1-8iSpNVj5KMw-00002 i forgive you and i do not hate you
rev1-8mPpe8AL21A-00001 because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group
rev1-8nbeD1mwCdo-00001 does the water stay there forever
rev1-8nt3edWLgIg-00001 we don't need moore's law to continue
rev1-8nt3edWLgIg-00003 we just need to keep going
rev1-8nt3edWLgIg-00004 we have problems that we desperately need to solve
rev1-8nt3edWLgIg-00005 i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of artificial intelligence
rev1-8vNIrPeRGlM-00001 it cracked open my world
rev1-8vNIrPeRGlM-00003 so they won't go for a walk they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat
rev1-8vNIrPeRGlM-00005 she would hide in the closet
rev1-8vNIrPeRGlM-00009 they want to know how often your dog gets outside
rev1-8vNIrPeRGlM-00010 they want to know how much exercise your dog is getting
rev1-8vNIrPeRGlM-00011 his name is lonnie hodge and he's a veteran of vietnam
rev1-95ovIJ3dsNk-00002 for hepatitis it was also two and a half times
rev1-95ovIJ3dsNk-00003 for depression it was four and a half times
rev1-95ovIJ3dsNk-00005 what kind of trauma am i talking about here
rev1-95ovIJ3dsNk-00006 children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
rev1-95ovIJ3dsNk-00009 well imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear
rev1-9B0PaSznWJE-00002 so thank you very much
rev1-9CqVYUOjHLw-00002 it's the war on terror
rev1-9JKy6ZfmBn0-00001 you don't get a chance to mess it up
rev1-9JKy6ZfmBn0-00002 one of them got caught up in the water
rev1-9RMx31GnNXY-00001 plus we have stem cells
rev1-9RMx31GnNXY-00002 i was able to do more things
rev1-9RMx31GnNXY-00003 i know i was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery
rev1-9RMx31GnNXY-00004 and when i was 10 i didn't realize how amazing it was
rev1-9TPFLHvn024-00002 there were no back doors
rev1-9YekkGz1E2k-00001 i had to do something
rev1-9YekkGz1E2k-00002 this fishing village was famous for sculpture
rev1-9kBKQS7J7xI-00001 i don't paint
rev1-9kBKQS7J7xI-00002 this is going to become really freaking obvious
rev1-9uOMectkCCs-00001 dan replies so often you won't even notice it
rev1-9uOMectkCCs-00002 and then something falls off the wall
rev1-9uOMectkCCs-00004 we all know what he's talking about
rev1-9uOMectkCCs-00005 that wasn't the case for me
rev1-9uOMectkCCs-00007 no more charge before use
rev1-AMVgX8cXsHA-00002 and that's bad
rev1-AO4In7d6XSc-00001 what about manipulation
rev1-AO4In7d6XSc-00002 so that's mobile manipulation
rev1-AO4In7d6XSc-00003 i love building robots
rev1-AWPrOvzzqZk-00002 and when you think about it it makes a lot of sense because forming a question is a really complex
rev1-AegIbt2j0sU-00001 and they also knew that they can tap into a workforce
rev1-AsSd2nmoKNA-00001 i tagged along with my neighbors
rev1-AsSd2nmoKNA-00002 and i said to myself i wanna get me one of them
rev1-AsSd2nmoKNA-00003 who wrote that
rev1-AsSd2nmoKNA-00004 i'll meet you there
rev1-B8rmi95pYL0-00002 the key here really is knowledge
rev1-BHY0FxzoKZE-00002 i tried everything
rev1-BHY0FxzoKZE-00003 maybe i did an experiment on myself without even knowing it
rev1-BImnT7lcLDE-00001 you just had to do things sometimes
rev1-BImnT7lcLDE-00002 and boy they were like what
rev1-BImnT7lcLDE-00003 how do you get to build those relationships
rev1-BImnT7lcLDE-00004 so we created a new school
rev1-BImnT7lcLDE-00006 but that doesn't mean that we can't
rev1-BQZKs75RMqM-00001 it's almost becoming the syntax of a new language
rev1-BhMKmovNjvc-00001 on the other hand statistics that's a subject that you could and should use
rev1-Bo8YN3oB0Cw-00002 this is what i'm supposed to naturally be able to do
rev1-Bo8YN3oB0Cw-00003 why is it not working
rev1-Bs86giWcjLA-00001 and you know what
rev1-Bs86giWcjLA-00002 they were right
rev1-Bs86giWcjLA-00004 it brings people together and it supports creativity and social cohesion
rev1-BvpmZktlBFs-00002 did you hear he has gone mad
rev1-BzeTjn0R2VY-00001 i mean everyone did
rev1-BzeTjn0R2VY-00003 again it will not happen overnight
rev1-BzeTjn0R2VY-00004 it needs to happen
rev1-CDsNZJTWw0w-00001 i have resources
rev1-CdZJ0SMbh10-00001 and is this really the solution
rev1-CgNx9Bgac1I-00002 so i went to my doctor
rev1-CgNx9Bgac1I-00003 but i'm not happy
rev1-ClfBxWPkBKU-00001 in other words a coroner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe
rev1-ClfBxWPkBKU-00003 and remember we had experience with this
rev1-ClfBxWPkBKU-00005 roughly 300 savings and loans involved roughly 600 senior officials
rev1-ClfBxWPkBKU-00008 that is not simply critical to our economy
rev1-ClfBxWPkBKU-00009 thank you very much
rev1-ClfBxWPkBKU-00010 what do we need to do
rev1-ClfBxWPkBKU-00011 what can we do in all of this
rev1-CxEqV8WtfOo-00001 i'm 27 years old
rev1-D8SSLLnV3W8-00001 that's more expensive
rev1-DCIL2nvU4x8-00001 and when we do the results will often surprise
rev1-DDaldVHUedI-00002 i wanted to stay in this relationship
rev1-DDaldVHUedI-00003 things were going well
rev1-DDaldVHUedI-00004 this is a really important chapter to me
rev1-DDaldVHUedI-00005 why are we skipping over this
rev1-DDaldVHUedI-00006 i went to the dean
rev1-DOgsYATbVSs-00001 but here's the thing
rev1-DOgsYATbVSs-00003 it's not like teaching them how to ride a bike
rev1-DOgsYATbVSs-00004 i don't know
rev1-DjeIpjhAqsM-00002 and that led me to this project
rev1-DjeIpjhAqsM-00003 we have to turn that around
rev1-DsrxbqFo41k-00002 so i went to church as often as i could
rev1-E0oPnS7rUwE-00001 it's a performance venue
rev1-E0oPnS7rUwE-00002 but it's not enough
rev1-E0oPnS7rUwE-00003 and they're not just focused on money
rev1-E0oPnS7rUwE-00006 i've built a career
rev1-E0oPnS7rUwE-00007 we are magic
rev1-E22icGCvGXk-00001 they're completely flat and they're basically cardboard characters
rev1-E22icGCvGXk-00004 i got about 3000 emails
rev1-E22icGCvGXk-00006 my own website
rev1-EGjxIS5MPUY-00001 it's always what it was and what it can be
rev1-EV3OmxrowWE-00001 they're not my children
rev1-EV3OmxrowWE-00003 and when we're unprepared we overreact
rev1-EV3OmxrowWE-00004 and i did not know what to say
rev1-EV3OmxrowWE-00007 we can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate locate
rev1-F3OhcpKSUBc-00001 and looking at that pattern
rev1-F3OhcpKSUBc-00004 he saw it written down somewhere
rev1-F3OhcpKSUBc-00006 and now we want to do a double double of the age wave coming through
rev1-F3OhcpKSUBc-00007 that's sort of the state of the art
rev1-F5h6ynoq8uM-00001 what's this guy talking about
rev1-F5h6ynoq8uM-00002 let me illustrate this
rev1-FD6CqD1kV8s-00001 and he's a bad guy
rev1-FD6CqD1kV8s-00003 there were others like myself who were full time
rev1-FD6CqD1kV8s-00004 it's not a dirty word
rev1-FD6CqD1kV8s-00005 the children were killed on the spot
rev1-FFG2rilqT2g-00003 well you get several things
rev1-FFG2rilqT2g-00004 the gas that they used at first in many cases was oxygen
rev1-FFG2rilqT2g-00005 so they added oxygen to methane gas
rev1-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00001 so what is an idea drawing
rev1-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00002 here i'm one person talking to you
rev1-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00003 you're all collective
rev1-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00007 and if it's completely okay what's the joke
rev1-FQEEMpzPZlY-00001 they change from person to person
rev1-FcmSmAwPkxg-00001 we've all done this
rev1-FcmSmAwPkxg-00005 when it's 10 degrees below zero
rev1-FcmSmAwPkxg-00006 there's love and there's friendship and there's protection
rev1-FcmSmAwPkxg-00007 you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive doses of chemotherapy
rev1-FcmSmAwPkxg-00008 we see it as a disruption of real life and important work
rev1-FcmSmAwPkxg-00010 she suffered so much
rev1-FcmSmAwPkxg-00012 could we merge
rev1-Fivy99RtMfM-00002 that's awful right
rev1-FmpIMt95ndU-00001 sort of leadership by humiliation
rev1-FmpIMt95ndU-00004 thanks for asking
rev1-FmpIMt95ndU-00005 i said where is he now
rev1-FqrLUtIFVjs-00001 so how does this work
rev1-FqrLUtIFVjs-00002 we change the economics for the bad guys
rev1-FxtSMZKMdes-00002 we have the right to respect
rev1-FxtSMZKMdes-00004 i'm a feminist but i'm a rather bad one
rev1-FxtSMZKMdes-00005 i am full of contradictions
rev1-FxtSMZKMdes-00006 i want no part of any of that
rev1-FxtSMZKMdes-00007 i enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things
rev1-FxtSMZKMdes-00009 we go far beyond reasonable constructive criticism to dissecting any given woman's feminism
rev1-FxtSMZKMdes-00010 they are gorgeous and headstrong brilliant girls who are a whole lot of brave
rev1-FxtSMZKMdes-00014 some boys broke me when i was so young i did not know what boys can do to break a girl
rev1-FxtSMZKMdes-00015 i learned to write like them and then i learned to write as myself
rev1-FxtSMZKMdes-00017 i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such bravery
rev1-G2XBIkHW954-00002 we're seeing the baby brain
rev1-GAMR5RDSLJo-00005 lots of money
rev1-GAMR5RDSLJo-00006 supporting local economies
rev1-GAMR5RDSLJo-00007 it's a top predator
rev1-GAMR5RDSLJo-00009 i love red wine
rev1-GAMR5RDSLJo-00010 i'm going to be so healthy
rev1-GAMR5RDSLJo-00011 i want to know how i impact them
rev1-GAMR5RDSLJo-00014 i want to know how they impact me
rev1-GAMR5RDSLJo-00016 so let's start there
rev1-GAMR5RDSLJo-00018 i made more money
rev1-GAMR5RDSLJo-00019 this is great
rev1-GAMR5RDSLJo-00020 we've seen an image of our blue planet our world bank
rev1-GGScU5ESei4-00001 but there's actually more to the story than that
rev1-GGScU5ESei4-00004 what's different is how the molecules are put together
rev1-GGScU5ESei4-00005 the oil will never run out
rev1-GIbz9ms9Z9k-00001 you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might go wrong
rev1-GIbz9ms9Z9k-00003 they want a treatment
rev1-GIbz9ms9Z9k-00004 we are all responsible
rev1-GMynksvCcUI-00001 my father worked at this factory he said
rev1-GMynksvCcUI-00002 my grandfather worked at this factory
rev1-GMynksvCcUI-00008 why not ask all of the states to do that instead
rev1-GMynksvCcUI-00009 and imagine what might happen because every region has something to offer
rev1-GSf6nijSSdA-00002 i've tried engaging people
rev1-GSf6nijSSdA-00003 and he surprised me by saying you know what
rev1-GSf6nijSSdA-00004 patriarchy is not boys and men
rev1-GSf6nijSSdA-00005 that allowed me to take a stand for myself
rev1-GSf6nijSSdA-00007 i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse including three
rev1-GSf6nijSSdA-00010 and guess what silicon valley
rev1-GSf6nijSSdA-00011 so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
rev1-GZadCj8O1S0-00001 so that's it for now
rev1-Gmai4zkKNcM-00001 it came from the way in which beijing has grown as a city
rev1-Gmai4zkKNcM-00002 that's really important
rev1-Gmai4zkKNcM-00003 and we couldn't just turn it off
rev1-Gmai4zkKNcM-00004 you're in there
rev1-Gmai4zkKNcM-00006 but the second of the transformations the climate transformations we have to decide to do
rev1-Gmai4zkKNcM-00007 we can see how to do that
rev1-GqnJFm1CS3c-00002 don't get me wrong it's not like we don't have comedy in the middle east
rev1-GvGAIGbnX7E-00001 they have to be able to teach us something as well
rev1-GvGAIGbnX7E-00004 and in that i need a surgery lexicon
rev1-H14bBuluwB8-00001 my research team and i went to west point military academy
rev1-H14bBuluwB8-00002 that's the work that stands before us
rev1-H9ZOpQzjukY-00001 we're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
rev1-HD4bpztESWw-00001 we're on the grid
rev1-HI7zfpitZpo-00002 who or what inspires you and why
rev1-HSercnrqeN4-00001 i exist because i have my women friends
rev1-HSercnrqeN4-00002 i don't know about you
rev1-HSercnrqeN4-00004 and guess what
rev1-HUM2rCIUdeI-00001 i looked at slaves
rev1-HUM2rCIUdeI-00003 there's no need to play the market
rev1-HUM2rCIUdeI-00004 it's not a lot of money at the global level
rev1-HbUeAdVXOVc-00001 this is the only part that's battery backed up
rev1-HdwOlk6HIVc-00001 and germany and france
rev1-HdwOlk6HIVc-00002 4 times the mass of the sun
rev1-HdwOlk6HIVc-00004 surely we know enough
rev1-HiwJ0hNl1Fw-00002 the same tool that united us to topple dictators
rev1-HiwJ0hNl1Fw-00003 i was terrified
rev1-Hj9oB4zpHww-00001 what is worth dying for
rev1-Hj9oB4zpHww-00003 that is what it is to have a domain of expertise
rev1-HqekWfSJCSA-00002 we can change our minds
rev1-Ht2fzax9wV0-00001 you need to be able to do something with it
rev1-Ht2fzax9wV0-00002 we're always trying to make it faster
rev1-IPBCxlxSSVk-00001 we will not be there
rev1-IS4IK8CiLg8-00001 what is that
rev1-IS4IK8CiLg8-00002 she contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work
rev1-IThAD5yKrgE-00001 it's not exactly rocket science
rev1-IWdzrZdRa38-00001 it's changed the way we talk
rev1-IWdzrZdRa38-00004 the board of ed
rev1-IWdzrZdRa38-00005 had no idea
rev1-IWdzrZdRa38-00006 they don't trust the law
rev1-IWdzrZdRa38-00007 why don't they trust the law
rev1-IWdzrZdRa38-00012 it's not true
rev1-IjbTiRbeNpM-00001 that was the only way to get anything done
rev1-IjbTiRbeNpM-00002 that's available right now
rev1-IjbTiRbeNpM-00003 art is not efficient
rev1-IjbTiRbeNpM-00004 human relationships are not efficient
rev1-IjbTiRbeNpM-00005 efficiency is for robots
rev1-Ip2SQa50uBI-00001 china is the world's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades
rev1-Ip2SQa50uBI-00003 how else can we create new ideas
rev1-Ip2SQa50uBI-00005 but some of our grandchildren probably will
rev1-J8FyHI00ELY-00001 that's what happened with my dad
rev1-J8FyHI00ELY-00002 my dad has alzheimer's disease
rev1-J8FyHI00ELY-00004 they get scared to walk around
rev1-J8FyHI00ELY-00005 they get scared to move
rev1-J8FyHI00ELY-00006 i'm trying to become a better person
rev1-J8FyHI00ELY-00008 even when it's so hard
rev1-J8FyHI00ELY-00009 and what i need now is to learn to be like that
rev1-JFQLvbVJVMg-00001 so this is obvious right
rev1-JFQLvbVJVMg-00003 so what's women's experience as it relates to mentoring
rev1-JHk9YVjhk7c-00001 is it that i write very well
rev1-JISHzvXk5bk-00001 quite the opposite
rev1-JP0w9lZoLwU-00002 thank you very much
rev1-JSSc7hYKstI-00005 especially when it comes to climate change
rev1-JSSc7hYKstI-00006 so i want to talk to you today about what i think is a much more complete recipe for deep
rev1-JSSc7hYKstI-00007 this meant that the movements demanding change knew what they were against crushing poverty widening
rev1-JSSc7hYKstI-00008 progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
rev1-JSSc7hYKstI-00010 well very often we think about political change in defined compartments these days
rev1-JSSc7hYKstI-00014 what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what its core values are
rev1-JSSc7hYKstI-00015 a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish
rev1-JSSc7hYKstI-00016 so we locked ourselves in a room for two days and we tried to figure out what bound us together
rev1-JSSc7hYKstI-00017 well we rejected all of that
rev1-JSSc7hYKstI-00019 but in the process they also train our brains to tune out when somebody else's issue
rev1-JTN9Nx8VYtk-00002 i don't have an answer
rev1-Jc9RdbHEFa0-00001 i don't know
rev1-JcJ3MfJNm6g-00001 the science is there
rev1-Jm2dWbNsnZI-00001 let's think about your ethical footprint
rev1-Jm2dWbNsnZI-00002 but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
rev1-KNSRifMSSvM-00001 and he wanted one so badly
rev1-KPNn880KWfU-00003 which brings me to my second point
rev1-KPNn880KWfU-00005 i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
rev1-KuWXfjyGhk0-00001 a huge opportunity unleashing of new potential for innovation for development
rev1-KuWXfjyGhk0-00004 there will be invisible capacity
rev1-KuWXfjyGhk0-00005 but the question is who will have it
rev1-KuWXfjyGhk0-00007 of course migration will become even more important
rev1-KuWXfjyGhk0-00009 and this change is getting more rapid
rev1-KvvjDOtS2sw-00005 i didn't always succeed
rev1-KvvjDOtS2sw-00006 i hadn't bathed in three days
rev1-KvvjDOtS2sw-00007 why are you really here
rev1-KvvjDOtS2sw-00010 and i cried
rev1-KvvjDOtS2sw-00012 i was winning awards
rev1-KvvjDOtS2sw-00013 i was living in my own apartment
rev1-KvvjDOtS2sw-00014 i was no longer homeless
rev1-KxLMjn4WPBY-00001 race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences
rev1-KxLMjn4WPBY-00002 i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to
rev1-LEx6K4P4GJc-00001 i know platforms i know computers they put me on the internet when i was young
rev1-LEx6K4P4GJc-00003 what would that change about how we live
rev1-LEx6K4P4GJc-00004 what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
rev1-LEx6K4P4GJc-00005 a digital world farm
rev1-LEx6K4P4GJc-00010 why didn't you just tell me that
rev1-LHHlPnfOtRo-00001 well that's exciting
rev1-LIckScLypGA-00001 and dance has progressed
rev1-LIckScLypGA-00002 and this is happening every day
rev1-LIy2oVJtJsA-00002 they're not donated
rev1-LIy2oVJtJsA-00003 they're not heavily subsidized
rev1-LIy2oVJtJsA-00006 and use is what creates impact
rev1-LYCKzpXEW6E-00001 how could i come from a nation
rev1-LYCKzpXEW6E-00002 what kind of rituals are these
rev1-LYCKzpXEW6E-00003 the rituals were familiar
rev1-Li4S1yyrsTI-00001 why do i believe this
rev1-Li4S1yyrsTI-00003 and you know what else we did
rev1-Li4S1yyrsTI-00007 and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
rev1-Li4S1yyrsTI-00009 and so knowing that we went to the advertising council and we asked them to help us
rev1-Li4S1yyrsTI-00010 we were making what was invisible visible
rev1-Li4S1yyrsTI-00011 take a look at one of our spots
rev1-Li4S1yyrsTI-00013 and let me just put this in context
rev1-Li4S1yyrsTI-00014 we were obviously making a difference
rev1-Li4S1yyrsTI-00015 but we were still missing a critical element
rev1-Li4S1yyrsTI-00016 and that's what we did
rev1-Li4S1yyrsTI-00021 we met men where they were at and we built a program
rev1-Li4S1yyrsTI-00022 and he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving
rev1-LiUClSItcy0-00001 texting has a 100 percent open rate
rev1-LiUClSItcy0-00004 i think it might be a lifeline
rev1-LiUClSItcy0-00005 he told me not to tell anyone
rev1-LiUClSItcy0-00006 it's my dad
rev1-LiUClSItcy0-00007 that last one's an actual text message that we received
rev1-LiUClSItcy0-00008 i will not forget the day we got that text message
rev1-LiUClSItcy0-00009 and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline
rev1-LjAsM1vAhW0-00001 the nazis invaded the netherlands
rev1-LpROaNue9GM-00001 but when i was little i remember he would kill flies in our house with my bb gun
rev1-LujWrkYsl64-00002 it was like a star trek episode you know
rev1-M0SbSz5Le10-00002 i started off in uganda
rev1-M5PiTCwoQRo-00001 well not so fast
rev1-M6TMSQWI9m4-00001 i'm in tucson
rev1-M7KSnq0xkWY-00001 we have to throw it away
rev1-MIAS1xQc7x8-00002 we can do it again
rev1-MNuOmTQdFjA-00001 and i don't have to do anything
rev1-MNuOmTQdFjA-00002 so i looked for furniture
rev1-MsLuQM5V3FA-00001 my other great passion is the environment
rev1-MsLuQM5V3FA-00002 i was considered a radical
rev1-MsLuQM5V3FA-00005 so let's get started now
rev1-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00003 go i said again sweat forming on my brow
rev1-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00006 i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
rev1-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00007 science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writing
rev1-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00009 it was faulty and most of the time i had to restart it over and over before it worked
rev1-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00011 for africans homegrown science fiction can be a will to power
rev1-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00012 it is in the water
rev1-MvXZzKZ3JYQ-00001 my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach terminal cancer
rev1-NA7krbsdXFA-00002 we suspended our values
rev1-NA7krbsdXFA-00003 and what was the result of that
rev1-NA7krbsdXFA-00005 but it's not just china
rev1-NA7krbsdXFA-00010 where are the philosophers
rev1-NA7krbsdXFA-00011 and that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you
rev1-NCJTV5KaJJc-00001 last week alone i got 238 pieces of nasty email and more
rev1-NCJTV5KaJJc-00002 but i'm a big fan of you as a person
rev1-NL0uxDscjdo-00001 and so they took them to some safe place
rev1-NL0uxDscjdo-00004 and in fact what did happen to my brain
rev1-NL0uxDscjdo-00005 i understand how this could happen
rev1-NYKcOFQCeno-00001 and that might have been the case
rev1-NYKcOFQCeno-00003 and that leads to a very powerful tool
rev1-NoCOagL69Ss-00001 to me it's not that clear
rev1-NoCOagL69Ss-00002 that may not always be the case
rev1-NqOjj1FCcVY-00001 imagine if we had across the country right now in local places but
rev1-NqOjj1FCcVY-00003 let me tell you about a couple of them
rev1-NqOjj1FCcVY-00004 it's just a wall
rev1-NqOjj1FCcVY-00005 i have passion in my heart
rev1-NqOjj1FCcVY-00006 i can stand up and do something
rev1-NqOjj1FCcVY-00007 both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
rev1-O0JDDyqtSVY-00001 but you know what
rev1-O0JDDyqtSVY-00002 but you know what
rev1-O3a9AYu5SUQ-00001 and that's pretty amazing
rev1-O6Vayv9FCLM-00001 that option is actually not on the table
rev1-O6Vayv9FCLM-00002 so it's up to us
rev1-ODLgS00f9BE-00002 we could only think of one way
rev1-OIlSXRCSBSI-00001 i even read many self help books
rev1-OIlSXRCSBSI-00002 the first lesson is about humility
rev1-OIlSXRCSBSI-00006 try it and let me know how it works for you
rev1-OIlSXRCSBSI-00007 i would love to hear from you
rev1-OM6XIICmSqo-00001 who's at the event
rev1-OM6XIICmSqo-00002 whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that
rev1-OM6XIICmSqo-00005 i can use it in my company
rev1-ONM4JupBzSE-00001 it's right there for you to find
rev1-ONM4JupBzSE-00003 there's nothing underground about it
rev1-ONM4JupBzSE-00005 we only sell you airtime
rev1-ORthzIOEf30-00001 it was appalling
rev1-OYfoGTIG7pY-00001 pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you
rev1-OYfoGTIG7pY-00002 i remember what you said to me
rev1-OYfoGTIG7pY-00003 i am thinking of your love for me
rev1-OYfoGTIG7pY-00004 i am torn by your love for me
rev1-OYfoGTIG7pY-00007 remember what i said my love
rev1-OYfoGTIG7pY-00010 and i said i don't know
rev1-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00002 when you really look at it how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies
rev1-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00003 you learn more about how computers work
rev1-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00004 he wanted to keep score
rev1-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00005 but it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write
rev1-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00003 you board the plane
rev1-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00004 the plane takes off
rev1-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00005 the engine fails
rev1-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00008 no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
rev1-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00009 they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios
rev1-OzA6jRYjVQs-00001 it's about people
rev1-OzA6jRYjVQs-00003 this is not a statement on malnutrition or anything else
rev1-OzA6jRYjVQs-00004 the net outcome
rev1-OzA6jRYjVQs-00006 china is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has available for agriculture and it has massive
rev1-OzA6jRYjVQs-00008 that even small scale farmers can leverage
rev1-OzA6jRYjVQs-00009 we just need to act on it
rev1-P2AUat93a8Q-00002 would you like to create a second one together
rev1-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00001 we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
rev1-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00004 he wouldn't like the answer
rev1-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00005 or any national leader
rev1-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00006 the supreme court has fallen way down from what it used to be
rev1-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00007 they were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites
rev1-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00009 they are doing it together
rev1-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00011 that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or
rev1-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00012 we can create a global parliament of mayors
rev1-PYHd7rpOTe8-00001 but you know what the actual facts are
rev1-PYHd7rpOTe8-00002 but now it's turned around
rev1-PYHd7rpOTe8-00003 then they had to bring them in
rev1-PaxNc5Sqn6s-00001 make it about the other party
rev1-PbgB2TaYhio-00001 well i think about this all the time
rev1-PbgB2TaYhio-00003 they all look the same under a microscope i mean to a first approximation
rev1-PbgB2TaYhio-00004 but now check out where they go on our tree of life
rev1-PbgB2TaYhio-00007 it's just not possible
rev1-PhVP1tNeGyY-00001 how cool is that
rev1-PrK0CifulU0-00003 now hamilton was everything madison was not
rev1-PrK0CifulU0-00004 and they did it in the good old fashioned way
rev1-PrK0CifulU0-00005 first they founded political parties
rev1-Q6U69HbAF9Y-00002 well we bought one of these
rev1-QKHkSUiQboA-00003 it's kind of the anti reality tv
rev1-QKHkSUiQboA-00004 nobody comes to get famous
rev1-QKHkSUiQboA-00005 and it's hard and it takes courage but that's why we're alive right
rev1-QKHkSUiQboA-00007 how are we going to do that
rev1-QeIrdqU0o9s-00002 i am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye
rev1-QeIrdqU0o9s-00004 how far away was the finish line
rev1-QeIrdqU0o9s-00006 so this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster
rev1-QleRgTBMX88-00001 i think this is a problem
rev1-QleRgTBMX88-00002 beth israel's in boston
rev1-QoT0S2vu9m4-00001 that's a terrible waste of time
rev1-QoT0S2vu9m4-00002 do that only if you're paid by the hour
rev1-QoyBYYpal1Y-00001 so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system
rev1-QuIS7J59SYw-00001 that's my question
rev1-RAR4cz9wkUk-00001 i was not going to cry myself to sleep
rev1-RAR4cz9wkUk-00002 i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
rev1-RCXGpEmFbOw-00001 there are no external cameras
rev1-RD07GkmM2fc-00001 in fact it's more like five percent
rev1-RD07GkmM2fc-00004 and we finally figured out how to do it
rev1-RDIy58g9n2k-00002 it's just incredible
rev1-RDSSLJG7oi8-00001 i'm not strong enough to lift my carry on bag from the ground to the carousel
rev1-RE4ce4mexrU-00002 it's not one way
rev1-RE4ce4mexrU-00004 and i thought what am i thinking
rev1-RE4ce4mexrU-00005 he's five years old
rev1-ROgFmb3oTLo-00001 they have different interests
rev1-ROgFmb3oTLo-00002 they have divergent values
rev1-ROgFmb3oTLo-00004 it means for youth and it's a new arab tv channel
rev1-ROgFmb3oTLo-00005 but it's not about fire and brimstone either
rev1-ROgFmb3oTLo-00007 there is an animated series in the works
rev1-ROgFmb3oTLo-00010 and she's looking as young as ever
rev1-RaSlxoAUP5c-00001 i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one
rev1-RaSlxoAUP5c-00003 which means take my camera
rev1-RaSlxoAUP5c-00004 and he thinks i'm saying take my picture
rev1-RiM5aSvaNkg-00001 i went to extreme lengths to try to be straight
rev1-RiM5aSvaNkg-00002 and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this
rev1-RiM5aSvaNkg-00003 but if you won't move we'll have no choice but to run you down
rev1-RlQ3CSVanaU-00001 i don't understand
rev1-RplnSVTzvnU-00001 we can see everything on wikipedia
rev1-RplnSVTzvnU-00002 it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated
rev1-RplnSVTzvnU-00003 we can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly
rev1-Rw9s0ivfn3w-00001 because we can
rev1-S2Dj9M71JAc-00003 so when we met chuck was a senior in high school
rev1-S2Dj9M71JAc-00006 not a single one
rev1-S2Dj9M71JAc-00007 the question for us now is how much can we make of it
rev1-S2Dj9M71JAc-00008 how much can we change
rev1-S6ufvYWTqQ0-00001 he was also the first person to call me a feminist
rev1-S6ufvYWTqQ0-00005 my brothers are not as interested as i am
rev1-S7t6Ry4PlTo-00001 it's been thought about for a while
rev1-SE97Kgi0sR4-00001 think about that
rev1-SE97Kgi0sR4-00002 they also monitored the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
rev1-SE97Kgi0sR4-00003 terrorists are doing this
rev1-SE97Kgi0sR4-00004 when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob
rev1-SE97Kgi0sR4-00005 of course we're going to go even deeper than the human body
rev1-SE97Kgi0sR4-00006 we're going down to the cellular level these days
rev1-SFnMTHhKdkw-00003 we can do this
rev1-SFnMTHhKdkw-00004 i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the worst
rev1-SFnMTHhKdkw-00005 i'm so sorry
rev1-SFnMTHhKdkw-00008 one year i came up with a bright idea
rev1-SFnMTHhKdkw-00009 we know why kids don't learn
rev1-SFnMTHhKdkw-00010 you made it work for me
rev1-SN7wO06Yz1E-00002 and they put on an opera all night long
rev1-SN7wO06Yz1E-00003 what is the abstraction
rev1-SN7wO06Yz1E-00004 it's so obvious
rev1-SN7wO06Yz1E-00005 you don't question that
rev1-SN7wO06Yz1E-00006 that's what moves you
rev1-SN7wO06Yz1E-00008 i'm in the crucible right now
rev1-SN7wO06Yz1E-00009 i know you understand that
rev1-SS8TSf2srSw-00002 seventy five percent of them are women and children
rev1-SS8TSf2srSw-00003 that was her fight
rev1-SS8TSf2srSw-00006 she got a support network
rev1-SS8TSf2srSw-00007 she learned about her rights
rev1-SS8TSf2srSw-00008 she was doing okay
rev1-SSzRfSJTNW4-00001 what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary
rev1-SSzRfSJTNW4-00003 why do we need to study this anymore
rev1-SSzRfSJTNW4-00005 don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization
rev1-SSzRfSJTNW4-00006 indeed we run the risk of making things worse
rev1-SSzRfSJTNW4-00007 imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics
rev1-SWiwSBLXS3k-00001 and not just that
rev1-SWiwSBLXS3k-00002 they met together
rev1-SWiwSBLXS3k-00003 why is it important now
rev1-SWiwSBLXS3k-00008 so what did they do
rev1-SWvJxasiSZ8-00004 but people did not relate to this
rev1-SWvJxasiSZ8-00005 i don't know
rev1-SWvJxasiSZ8-00006 people started contributing ideas
rev1-SWvJxasiSZ8-00009 and that's actually what happened
rev1-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00001 you see there's a lot of things we just don't have data on
rev1-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00002 it's a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world
rev1-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00003 but we're not there yet
rev1-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00004 with that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen
rev1-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00008 data drives better decisions
rev1-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00010 it's a win all around
rev1-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00012 and that's a big deal for a profession that's in high demand
rev1-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00013 there's going to be a new system based on donated package tracking technology from the logistics company that i work for
rev1-SaouBn7IKIo-00001 we've been working together since well since we were kids really
rev1-SaouBn7IKIo-00002 which brought us to this
rev1-Sbm98rrVZzE-00001 but i need your help
rev1-Sddb0Khx0yA-00001 so what to do next
rev1-Sew0bn8mGAA-00002 the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place
rev1-Sew0bn8mGAA-00004 what do they have
rev1-Sew0bn8mGAA-00006 do they have aids
rev1-Sew0bn8mGAA-00007 do they have a common cold
rev1-Sew0bn8mGAA-00009 you make it flow under and over
rev1-Sktdq5z1NS4-00001 and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more
rev1-SmLeSPk3ddE-00001 take a look at these
rev1-SnSHsb5xKPo-00001 it took six days to deploy a global malware campaign
rev1-SnSHsb5xKPo-00002 it should be inspiring
rev1-SpTGUTSFvf4-00001 some did not everybody
rev1-SpTGUTSFvf4-00003 even that wasn't enough
rev1-SpTGUTSFvf4-00004 she wanted to change policy at the government level
rev1-SsqlpgMKjyU-00001 i actually have no idea why
rev1-SsqlpgMKjyU-00002 i didn't talk to them
rev1-SsqlpgMKjyU-00003 go pick up the keys
rev1-Sv5QitqbxJw-00003 they're too busy putting out daily fires to think ahead strategically
rev1-Sv5QitqbxJw-00004 and they don't need to ask for permission
rev1-TDaFwnOiKVE-00002 and i said that's a good job
rev1-TDaFwnOiKVE-00003 this isn't information
rev1-TDaFwnOiKVE-00004 it's super real and it's happening around you
rev1-TGZMSmcuiXM-00001 that's what's so complicated about war
rev1-TGZMSmcuiXM-00002 it was incredibly hot
rev1-TGZMSmcuiXM-00003 how does that work
rev1-TGZMSmcuiXM-00004 it's not what i had expected
rev1-TGZMSmcuiXM-00008 what is it that he misses
rev1-TGZMSmcuiXM-00009 we have to answer that
rev1-TGZMSmcuiXM-00012 the boys are up there for a year
rev1-TGZMSmcuiXM-00013 some of them got out of the army and had tremendous psychological problems when they got home
rev1-TRajLqEaWhQ-00002 that means at some point it's going to be your problem too
rev1-TScetimMBL8-00002 i realize of course that all countries are unique
rev1-TScetimMBL8-00003 that's nothing special
rev1-TScetimMBL8-00004 it had no choice
rev1-TScetimMBL8-00005 again it had no choice
rev1-TScetimMBL8-00006 just when that's the last thing you want to do
rev1-TUgBdSyK7S4-00001 i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
rev1-TUxwiVFgghE-00001 how much they do
rev1-TVtgb153S6I-00001 and we connected over really small things like the fact that i love country music which is really
rev1-TVtgb153S6I-00002 this is not a photo profile for your facebook
rev1-U6FvJ6jMGHU-00002 that didn't go over really well
rev1-U6FvJ6jMGHU-00003 so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free
rev1-U6PoUg7jXsA-00001 the answer was no
rev1-U6PoUg7jXsA-00002 do you remember what it was
rev1-U6PoUg7jXsA-00004 and i got pretty into it
rev1-U6PoUg7jXsA-00005 this is how stuff is made memorable
rev1-UAinLaT42xY-00001 what makes technology useful and usable
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00001 i will craft my own drum
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00003 i will not be played
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00006 we mourn women complicated
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00011 i live cycles of light and darkness
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00012 rhythm is half silence
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00013 i see now i never was one and not the other
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00014 sickness health tender violence
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00016 one woman loses her head
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00017 one woman feeds on trash
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00018 one woman shoots her face
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00019 one woman straps herself
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00020 one woman gives birth to a baby
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00021 one woman gives birth to borders
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00022 one woman no longer believes love will ever find her
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00023 one woman never did
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00024 where do refugee hearts go
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00025 faced with absence
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00027 my spine curves spiral
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00028 cluster bombs left behind
rev1-UAj1hsXp18c-00030 harvest contaminated tobacco
rev1-UAq4yBdSYZs-00001 so after 25 years i began to feel as though i was running dry
rev1-UAq4yBdSYZs-00002 they will sit in them forever
rev1-UK8ccWSZkic-00001 of those seven have nuclear weapons
rev1-ULNPLFrTirQ-00001 i'm pushing and pulling with this object
rev1-UMhLBPPtlrY-00002 she got unlucky
rev1-UMhLBPPtlrY-00004 what if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all
rev1-UMhLBPPtlrY-00005 that wasn't being asked
rev1-UZmXwOgNq7c-00001 only one percent of the people are actually farmers
rev1-UZmXwOgNq7c-00002 so what can we do
rev1-UZmXwOgNq7c-00005 talk to farmers
rev1-UmvOgW6iV2s-00001 casual speech is something quite different
rev1-UmvOgW6iV2s-00002 that's what texting is
rev1-UmvOgW6iV2s-00003 it's a marker of empathy
rev1-UmvOgW6iV2s-00004 any spoken language that's used by real people has them
rev1-UmvOgW6iV2s-00007 texting has developed one from this slash
rev1-Us70DN2XSfM-00001 like why did i really have to mow the lawn
rev1-Us70DN2XSfM-00002 you can't run around in the dark
rev1-Us70DN2XSfM-00003 you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
rev1-Us70DN2XSfM-00005 and it's not that they didn't want me to think critically
rev1-UtBsl3j0YRQ-00002 you haven't earned it
rev1-UtBsl3j0YRQ-00004 we have to get quiet
rev1-UtBsl3j0YRQ-00006 how can we do it
rev1-V1yW5IsnSjo-00001 i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trap disguised as love one
rev1-V1yW5IsnSjo-00003 which is why that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future
rev1-V1yW5IsnSjo-00004 and here's where those guns come in
rev1-V1yW5IsnSjo-00005 he kept one in the glove compartment of our car
rev1-V1yW5IsnSjo-00006 i had just graduated from harvard college
rev1-V1yW5IsnSjo-00008 the question why does she stay
rev1-V1yW5IsnSjo-00009 show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your coworkers your friends and
rev1-V4sSabKqyMU-00001 but there's so much potential
rev1-V4sSabKqyMU-00002 and i went back home and i said daddy i don't know who i am
rev1-V4sSabKqyMU-00003 so since then i've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
rev1-V4sSabKqyMU-00004 brought in younger men
rev1-V4sSabKqyMU-00005 it's about proving who you are and what you can do
rev1-V4sSabKqyMU-00006 and this is true
rev1-VAJS5J21Rd0-00001 are they attractive
rev1-VAJS5J21Rd0-00003 are they a potential mate
rev1-VAJS5J21Rd0-00004 when you're six maybe you can do that
rev1-VAJS5J21Rd0-00005 i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
rev1-VAJS5J21Rd0-00008 how old are you
rev1-VAJS5J21Rd0-00009 so i changed my immediate goal to 10000 faces
rev1-VIgzTLDyObo-00001 so momentum is good
rev1-VIgzTLDyObo-00002 often what happens is you're planning so hard for like how do i get through the hardest part
rev1-VIgzTLDyObo-00003 how do i get through the hardest part
rev1-VIgzTLDyObo-00004 and then what happens
rev1-VSLurJfOSiA-00001 and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things
rev1-VSLurJfOSiA-00002 you were born to
rev1-VSLurJfOSiA-00005 that's what we do
rev1-VfAiNX7jn9A-00001 young people as well
rev1-VfAiNX7jn9A-00004 and that's what we did
rev1-VfAiNX7jn9A-00006 we hear the chaos of war
rev1-VfAiNX7jn9A-00007 we hear terrorism
rev1-VfAiNX7jn9A-00010 the silent majority does not need to be silent
rev1-VfAiNX7jn9A-00011 let's help them have a voice
rev1-VfAiNX7jn9A-00012 thank you very much
rev1-VsjTVGIw4z8-00003 and we all know this
rev1-VsjTVGIw4z8-00005 okay then we can make a mobile geiger counter
rev1-VsjTVGIw4z8-00006 we can drive around
rev1-VsjTVGIw4z8-00007 we can get volunteers
rev1-VsjTVGIw4z8-00008 we don't have enough money
rev1-VxESitIllxE-00001 and then we were alarmed to discover something
rev1-VxESitIllxE-00002 no plankton means no fish
rev1-VxESitIllxE-00004 as an inventor i try and turn fantasy into reality
rev1-VxESitIllxE-00007 not when you get lung cancer
rev1-VzyjDRSAWzE-00001 it's an unconscious process
rev1-VzyjDRSAWzE-00002 it's an automatic process
rev1-WFCvkkDSfIU-00002 one way around this is to draw pictures
rev1-WFCvkkDSfIU-00003 and this idea is actually nothing new
rev1-WT7VMrxTPPA-00001 there's no other way
rev1-WT7VMrxTPPA-00003 i mean i thought poetry was just self expression
rev1-WT7VMrxTPPA-00004 i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
rev1-WTFi99e4RXU-00001 only we don't know that it's a homeless shelter
rev1-XBJQENjZJaA-00001 5 percent today
rev1-XBJQENjZJaA-00002 how is that possible
rev1-XBJQENjZJaA-00003 that's different from actually having an effective ad campaign
rev1-XESFPEFpHt4-00001 where would it go
rev1-XESFPEFpHt4-00002 you can walk around them
rev1-XESFPEFpHt4-00003 was the internet actually a place that you could visit
rev1-XESFPEFpHt4-00004 could i go there
rev1-XESFPEFpHt4-00005 who would i meet
rev1-XESFPEFpHt4-00007 the whole internet
rev1-XESFPEFpHt4-00008 is it heavy
rev1-XESFPEFpHt4-00010 i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for
rev1-XESFPEFpHt4-00011 you can experience their sense of place
rev1-XESFPEFpHt4-00013 we let other people worry about it
rev1-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00001 so i learned never to move
rev1-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00005 it would skip a beat
rev1-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00006 it would start
rev1-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00007 it would stop
rev1-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00008 and i felt all this
rev1-XNbaR54Gpj4-00001 does any of this matter
rev1-XYNUpQrZISc-00001 why is that hard
rev1-XYNUpQrZISc-00002 that will change everything when we see that
rev1-YD5PFdghryc-00001 and so many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where i would walk across borders
rev1-YyXRYgjQXX0-00001 the answer to that question is a very definitive
rev1-YyXRYgjQXX0-00002 and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers that i would never sell them one of our crappy products
rev1-YyXRYgjQXX0-00007 it's all about what can you do for me
rev1-YyXRYgjQXX0-00008 agreeable people are warm and friendly they're nice they're polite
rev1-YyXRYgjQXX0-00010 whereas giving and taking are more of your inner motives what are your values
rev1-YyXRYgjQXX0-00011 what are your intentions toward others
rev1-YyXRYgjQXX0-00013 they'll say i'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks
rev1-YzGjO5aHShQ-00002 and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the
rev1-YzGjO5aHShQ-00004 i was talking about interaction design
rev1-YzGjO5aHShQ-00005 and does it matter
rev1-YzGjO5aHShQ-00006 you know it's like once again there's this whole problem of design being often misunderstood for art
rev1-YzGjO5aHShQ-00007 designers aspire to be really great designers
rev1-YzGjO5aHShQ-00012 what we want what we aspire to is the code
rev1-YzGjO5aHShQ-00013 it's very hard to get of course
rev1-YzGjO5aHShQ-00016 we're going to stay with them forever
rev1-YzGjO5aHShQ-00017 i mean that interface is beautiful
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00001 it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in trenton
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00002 now at that time camden new jersey was the most dangerous city in america
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00003 i ran the camden police department because of that
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00004 and they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00005 and one of them said we had a robbery two weeks ago
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00007 we have no suspects
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00008 we have no suspects
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00012 it worked for the oakland a's and it worked in the state of new jersey
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00013 we took camden off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in america
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00016 and all of this matters greatly because public safety to me is the most important function of
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00019 they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00020 they're just waiting for their day in court
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00021 and 67 percent of people come back
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00023 so when i started my job at the arnold foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00024 and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i feel the exact same way that i did about the state of
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00025 so i decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make the most critical decision
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00026 it impacts everything
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00027 it impacts sentencing
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00029 it impacts crime and violence
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00030 and when i talk to judges around the united states which i do all the time now they all say the same
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00031 but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00033 and i couldn't get this information out
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00035 and at the other end of the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00037 they're like the baseball scouts 20 years ago
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00044 some people call it data science
rev1-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00047 they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
rev1-Zd71719SG8Y-00001 thank you very much
rev1-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00001 but things have changed
rev1-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00004 but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
rev1-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00006 and that's exactly what that is
rev1-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00007 we do train them however to adjust caution according to where they are
rev1-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00008 out to dinner with family
rev1-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00009 you remember carlos
rev1-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00010 he wanted to sit where he could scan the room where he could plan escape routes where he could get his hands
rev1-Zo62S0ulqhA-00001 how do you change your behavior
rev1-Zo62S0ulqhA-00003 he could come over and help me
rev1-aSavBsX60Ss-00001 and it doesn't
rev1-aSavBsX60Ss-00003 so naturally i asked what is african
rev1-akiQuyhXR8o-00001 i don't look different
rev1-akiQuyhXR8o-00002 i'm not short
rev1-akiQuyhXR8o-00003 again let's just play
rev1-akiQuyhXR8o-00004 i needed an education
rev1-akiQuyhXR8o-00005 now i'm ready for my interview
rev1-akiQuyhXR8o-00006 i was right there with you
rev1-akiQuyhXR8o-00007 did i get my upgrade
rev1-akiQuyhXR8o-00010 we must adopt that way of giving back
rev1-akiQuyhXR8o-00011 that doesn't probably happen every day
rev1-aoGJP02CtPA-00002 if any child is found violating these rules he is severely reprimanded
rev1-aoGJP02CtPA-00003 effectively the taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information
rev1-aoGJP02CtPA-00004 their parents are so poor they have no resources to get them back
rev1-aupPrDnhrKA-00001 thank you for your time
rev1-aupPrDnhrKA-00002 i'll let you continue
rev1-b6YTQJVzwlI-00001 so what happens next
rev1-bArH8r8jJ4g-00001 it turns out the evidence says otherwise
rev1-bArH8r8jJ4g-00002 none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people
rev1-bArH8r8jJ4g-00004 it's a pretty simple idea right
rev1-bS6SiVz1R0o-00001 it is the default option
rev1-bS6SiVz1R0o-00002 you just move away
rev1-bS6SiVz1R0o-00003 you're more cautious
rev1-bS6SiVz1R0o-00004 and you walk around and it points to things
rev1-c0KYU2j0TM4-00001 that is great
rev1-c0KYU2j0TM4-00002 thank you very much
rev1-c64M1tZyWPM-00001 so why is it
rev1-c64M1tZyWPM-00002 why aren't people washing their hands
rev1-c64M1tZyWPM-00003 did you learn to wash your hands at home
rev1-c64M1tZyWPM-00004 did you learn to wash your hands in school
rev1-c9V6OKlY80k-00001 but i love it for a totally different reason
rev1-c9V6OKlY80k-00002 they make sense of the past
rev1-cHRZ6OrSvvI-00001 three billion people today with cell phones can't access the internet
rev1-cHRZ6OrSvvI-00002 don't create solutions to impress customers
rev1-cmpu58yv8Sg-00001 we harbor bias
rev1-cmpu58yv8Sg-00002 we know that we are right and they are wrong
rev1-cmpu58yv8Sg-00004 well that's what i thought
rev1-cmpu58yv8Sg-00005 if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video for example your answer
rev1-cmpu58yv8Sg-00007 harness your internal strength
rev1-d3syTrElgcg-00001 look at the end to see the animal
rev1-d6NKdnZvdoo-00002 just think about it
rev1-d6NKdnZvdoo-00003 but it's a global phenomenon
rev1-dS8n24ZwZcQ-00001 one billion people
rev1-dS8n24ZwZcQ-00002 but the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate
rev1-dYNc3P4jSt4-00001 so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
rev1-dYNc3P4jSt4-00004 she never had to duck and cover under her desk at school
rev1-dYNc3P4jSt4-00006 but before that cooperation could be realized kennedy was assassinated and that part of the
rev1-dYNc3P4jSt4-00007 but it's also an important date for another reason
rev1-dYNc3P4jSt4-00008 have inspired a generation of innovators
rev1-ddxHlkIuHqg-00001 i'm a doctor
rev1-ddxHlkIuHqg-00002 but too often my treatments made them feel worse
rev1-ddxHlkIuHqg-00004 we can do that because we know
rev1-eNAHVnkll5M-00001 who cleans up after us
rev1-eNAHVnkll5M-00002 i wanted to get to know them as individuals
rev1-eNAHVnkll5M-00003 i wanted to understand who takes the job
rev1-eNAHVnkll5M-00004 so i started a research project with them
rev1-eNAHVnkll5M-00005 it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
rev1-eNAHVnkll5M-00008 the economy needs them
rev1-eNAHVnkll5M-00011 take a moment to say thank you
rev1-eVFYhbHpfqU-00001 please sign here right now
rev1-eVFYhbHpfqU-00002 why does a jellyfish emit light
rev1-eVFYhbHpfqU-00003 or a firefly
rev1-eVFYhbHpfqU-00007 and that's powerful
rev1-eVFYhbHpfqU-00008 no not how much
rev1-eVFYhbHpfqU-00009 it's more annoying
rev1-eVFYhbHpfqU-00011 it goes wrong
rev1-eZj5n8ScTkI-00001 i couldn't tear myself away from the coverage
rev1-eZj5n8ScTkI-00002 and others resented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights and
rev1-eZj5n8ScTkI-00003 and this wasn't just an abstract question
rev1-eZj5n8ScTkI-00005 african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded
rev1-emW1TQ290ec-00001 can we really scale this up
rev1-eqsXcSaefKI-00001 everything in the universe wears out
rev1-eqsXcSaefKI-00002 and that blew my mind
rev1-esD6aaIjhek-00001 they don't have meaning
rev1-fC9da6eqaqg-00001 you're doing incredibly important work
rev1-fIICVeGW4RY-00001 you are a healer in a stone age village
rev1-fIICVeGW4RY-00003 but eventually they did come around
rev1-fIICVeGW4RY-00004 and so it's perfect for something like that
rev1-fIICVeGW4RY-00006 we need to see beyond the surface
rev1-fTSXvLzNd0o-00002 there won't be a single moment in the schedule
rev1-fZ8eyWBQmfU-00001 now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic
rev1-fscaRh2OtXk-00002 i am sick to my stomach
rev1-fscaRh2OtXk-00003 how do you know for sure
rev1-fscaRh2OtXk-00004 we created a diagnostic test
rev1-fxbCHn6gE3U-00001 i'm the opposite
rev1-fxbCHn6gE3U-00003 then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are
rev1-fxbCHn6gE3U-00005 so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get better at my job i just need to upgrade my browser
rev1-fxbCHn6gE3U-00007 they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all
rev1-fxbCHn6gE3U-00008 they have bad ideas
rev1-gSycQufrgK4-00001 that's next to impossible
rev1-gSycQufrgK4-00002 so i went in that direction
rev1-gVfgkFaswn4-00001 this is a crisis that's getting worse day by day
rev1-gVfgkFaswn4-00002 so the answer to the second question can we change
rev1-gVfgkFaswn4-00003 we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
rev1-gVfgkFaswn4-00006 but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is
rev1-gtpTd3ywwiE-00001 but that's kind of a big problem
rev1-hQigUH0vZSE-00001 and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
rev1-hiIcwt88o94-00001 i just disagree with this
rev1-hiIcwt88o94-00002 like we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share
rev1-hiIcwt88o94-00003 and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity man or woman
rev1-hiIcwt88o94-00005 i want to go
rev1-hiIcwt88o94-00006 and i was like oh the amazon
rev1-hiIcwt88o94-00008 they grow crops
rev1-hiIcwt88o94-00010 there's people everywhere
rev1-hiIcwt88o94-00017 and this is crazy
rev1-hiIcwt88o94-00018 and i'm sure the figures are similar in other countries
rev1-hiIcwt88o94-00019 every kid lives near nature
rev1-hiIcwt88o94-00020 we've just somehow forgotten how to see it
rev1-hiIcwt88o94-00023 there's pollination going on
rev1-hxsnKwmW0dk-00002 we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
rev1-hxsnKwmW0dk-00003 i have an idea for saving the world
rev1-iPE2SiCCo0w-00001 most of my friends were taking japanese
rev1-iPE2SiCCo0w-00002 so i thought why not punish myself
rev1-iPE2SiCCo0w-00004 i was always very small
rev1-iPE2SiCCo0w-00007 so water was something that scared me to begin with
rev1-iPE2SiCCo0w-00008 but i would go in on occasion
rev1-iPE2SiCCo0w-00009 and i thought this would be great fun
rev1-iPE2SiCCo0w-00013 and this routine went on for some time
rev1-iPE2SiCCo0w-00015 i tried everything
rev1-iPE2SiCCo0w-00018 and this became my holy grail my rosetta stone
rev1-iPE2SiCCo0w-00021 and now i love languages
rev1-iPE2SiCCo0w-00023 i know nothing
rev1-iqEHuBST2qQ-00001 and then i thought there's got to be a better way
rev1-j7fRIGphgtk-00001 well i didn't have any idea
rev1-j7fRIGphgtk-00002 our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
rev1-j7fRIGphgtk-00004 i had to have faith
rev1-j7fRIGphgtk-00005 it would be a mall and not a park
rev1-jPf0LjZAS14-00001 is it about earning as much as you possibly can
rev1-jPf0LjZAS14-00003 how should we work
rev1-jPf0LjZAS14-00004 how should we live
rev1-jPf0LjZAS14-00008 we need portable health benefits
rev1-jPf0LjZAS14-00009 i would never want to do that
rev1-jPf0LjZAS14-00010 we need to reinvent labor organizing
rev1-jbHpF7EySck-00001 they want to be part of it
rev1-jbHpF7EySck-00002 and they say i want to work in global poverty but what will it mean about my career
rev1-jcSSY9rDN2g-00001 there's a flip side as well
rev1-jcSSY9rDN2g-00002 it's shocking to realize that only 28 percent of american
rev1-jcp5vvxtEaU-00001 how do you get informed
rev1-jcp5vvxtEaU-00002 we paid two to three times more than anybody else
rev1-jcp5vvxtEaU-00004 there's no more of it
rev1-jcp5vvxtEaU-00006 let's go back and visit our equation
rev1-jcp5vvxtEaU-00008 we're not going to be able to do that
rev1-jcp5vvxtEaU-00009 even if we get everybody working on it we've got to be strategic
rev1-jcp5vvxtEaU-00010 so we did the analysis again a slightly different way
rev1-jcp5vvxtEaU-00011 so it's the demand that brings them to the table
rev1-jcp5vvxtEaU-00012 sustainability has got to be a pre competitive issue
rev1-jggHw5PdQV0-00001 and my whole world did open up
rev1-jggHw5PdQV0-00002 and who does that benefit
rev1-jggHw5PdQV0-00003 we now have a platform
rev1-jiUKpX09zo4-00001 it really is quite phenomenal
rev1-jtVIDBs60S8-00001 that was powerful
rev1-jtVIDBs60S8-00004 it's actually not that hard
rev1-jtVIDBs60S8-00005 raise your hands
rev1-k2hQL9Zrokk-00001 take my child
rev1-k2hQL9Zrokk-00002 i believe a story there has to be told
rev1-k2hQL9Zrokk-00003 they don't get their money out
rev1-k2hQL9Zrokk-00005 she worked in a bank
rev1-k2hQL9Zrokk-00006 i have to report it
rev1-k2hQL9Zrokk-00008 who cares about bosnia
rev1-kEKzl6fub2w-00001 which incidentally is only a third correct
rev1-kEKzl6fub2w-00002 i don't mean giving up the internet
rev1-kEKzl6fub2w-00003 this is your chance
rev1-ka8L1YMR88U-00001 that didn't happen to me
rev1-ka8L1YMR88U-00004 make it go away
rev1-ka8L1YMR88U-00005 make it go away
rev1-ka8L1YMR88U-00006 make it go away
rev1-ka8L1YMR88U-00008 we can't identify with that part
rev1-kcEIsbO0ivA-00001 you might get impeached for that
rev1-kwYxHPXIaao-00001 well not yet
rev1-l5vZHuAtDZA-00001 well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
rev1-l5vZHuAtDZA-00003 so was mother teresa
rev1-lmyZMtPVodo-00001 that is some deep deep emotion when you would want to do that
rev1-lmyZMtPVodo-00002 we have no control over these forces
rev1-lrSmXnUoUXM-00002 well guess what
rev1-lrSmXnUoUXM-00003 now i know why i'm here
rev1-m6X1i8khmt8-00001 and i was really scared
rev1-m6X1i8khmt8-00002 the irony is so obvious right
rev1-m6X1i8khmt8-00004 but i found one
rev1-mSHBma0Ithk-00001 they want to get out
rev1-mSHBma0Ithk-00002 allow many people to come in
rev1-mSHBma0Ithk-00003 let us have a hong kong nearby
rev1-mSHBma0Ithk-00006 when we share ideas we all get more
rev1-mc0vhSseGk4-00001 so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really
rev1-mgcjr1yz7ow-00002 is it about systems
rev1-mgcjr1yz7ow-00003 is it about equality
rev1-mgcjr1yz7ow-00005 i started looking at them really carefully
rev1-mgcjr1yz7ow-00006 i looked at my friend who drilled seven dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
rev1-mgcjr1yz7ow-00008 these guys could be true to their purpose which was finding oil and gas
rev1-mgcjr1yz7ow-00009 and they were basically having fun
rev1-mgcjr1yz7ow-00013 we need to be part of a community to survive
rev1-mgcjr1yz7ow-00015 it's very hard to make them part of our rational decision
rev1-mgcjr1yz7ow-00016 we all know deep inside what the answer is
rev1-mgcjr1yz7ow-00017 we've known since we were babies
rev1-mjDjbJJlqZ0-00001 we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place
rev1-mxNpNuogqsY-00003 what are the researchers learning
rev1-mxNpNuogqsY-00004 so i was jealous
rev1-mxNpNuogqsY-00005 i know i didn't
rev1-mxNpNuogqsY-00006 i think i'm a normal person
rev1-n3kNlFMXslo-00002 that's like finding an extra hour in the day
rev1-n3kNlFMXslo-00003 yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found
rev1-n3kNlFMXslo-00005 so how do we do that
rev1-n3kNlFMXslo-00006 but you can write it
rev1-n3kNlFMXslo-00010 you say you're working more than 60 hours
rev1-n3kNlFMXslo-00011 well are you sure
rev1-n3kNlFMXslo-00012 and that's even if you're working way more than full time hours
rev1-n3kNlFMXslo-00013 we don't even need that much time to do amazing things
rev1-nASJ0510Pxs-00002 so they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them
rev1-nASJ0510Pxs-00003 thanks very much
rev1-nCg2NcGYu34-00001 why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
rev1-nCg2NcGYu34-00004 he also had 11 children
rev1-nCg2NcGYu34-00006 not the wife not the kids
rev1-nCg2NcGYu34-00008 i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
rev1-nCg2NcGYu34-00009 please look at me
rev1-nCg2NcGYu34-00011 who is going to inherit his name and his fortune
rev1-nCg2NcGYu34-00012 he should not have been surprised
rev1-nG3vB2CuSjM-00001 not right now
rev1-ni4FV5zL6lM-00001 government officials are extremely mad
rev1-ni4FV5zL6lM-00003 but those surveillance features come at a cost
rev1-npNYP2vzaPo-00001 how can we get so much information out of so little motion
rev1-npNYP2vzaPo-00002 we would just get noise back
rev1-npNYP2vzaPo-00004 we push and pull and poke and prod things
rev1-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00001 how do you find a dinosaur
rev1-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00002 that's the magic of the geological record
rev1-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00003 but we only get one history and it's the one that we have
rev1-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00004 but this particular reality was not inevitable
rev1-oDNgnrtSD8w-00001 come on man
rev1-oYp5XuGYqqY-00002 we were wrong
rev1-oYp5XuGYqqY-00003 now that's a very very good point
rev1-ooAIIeo4AJQ-00001 you smell money
rev1-ooAIIeo4AJQ-00002 we wouldn't tolerate that
rev1-ooAIIeo4AJQ-00003 thank you very much
rev1-os69gEFXUW4-00001 what can i learn with you
rev1-pFDoCLf96Kg-00001 and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance
rev1-pnv5iKB2hl4-00001 i don't care
rev1-psN1DORYYV0-00002 at what point did i think that was a good idea
rev1-psN1DORYYV0-00004 she said yeah
rev1-psN1DORYYV0-00005 why did you bring this up
rev1-psN1DORYYV0-00006 have you lost your mind
rev1-psN1DORYYV0-00008 i'm a fifth generation texan
rev1-psN1DORYYV0-00012 it's the best way to shut people down on an airplane
rev1-psN1DORYYV0-00013 what do you do
rev1-psN1DORYYV0-00014 i study shame
rev1-psN1DORYYV0-00016 i guess i'm doing it right now
rev1-psN1DORYYV0-00017 your wife left you
rev1-psN1DORYYV0-00018 i made a mistake
rev1-psN1DORYYV0-00019 and here's what you need to know
rev1-psN1DORYYV0-00020 he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms
rev1-q2gO4DKVpa8-00001 i am certainly not the hardest working
rev1-q2gO4DKVpa8-00002 i was a mediocre student
rev1-q2gO4DKVpa8-00004 it has never happened
rev1-q2gO4DKVpa8-00005 i was the first non family investor in amazon
rev1-q2gO4DKVpa8-00006 this is nonsense
rev1-qWNae7vYK6s-00001 thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame
rev1-qWNae7vYK6s-00002 and when she went to complain to a major he said what
rev1-qWNae7vYK6s-00003 again in a car
rev1-qWNae7vYK6s-00004 i was petrified
rev1-qWNae7vYK6s-00006 sexual harassment doesn't discriminate
rev1-qWNae7vYK6s-00007 not a lot of hands
rev1-qWNae7vYK6s-00008 you don't get the same witnesses or depositions
rev1-qWNae7vYK6s-00009 they just do it
rev1-qYUmI5kGsYk-00001 so we need the solutions and these people playing the game they are trying out
rev1-qafSjNLjedo-00001 and we've all heard that kind of story before right
rev1-qlty0OPcU6k-00001 now do something different
rev1-qlty0OPcU6k-00002 that would not work
rev1-qsJYrwzfd6w-00004 and after that initial prototype we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have
rev1-qsJYrwzfd6w-00005 and then guess what
rev1-qsJYrwzfd6w-00006 could we leverage the cloud
rev1-qsJYrwzfd6w-00007 so why don't we leverage that
rev1-rBKV4rOgSJU-00008 and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
rev1-rFpDK2KhAgw-00001 they have social meaning
rev1-rFpDK2KhAgw-00002 they were unexpected pleasures
rev1-rFpDK2KhAgw-00003 sometimes it goes further
rev1-rFpDK2KhAgw-00006 or where does he live
rev1-rFpDK2KhAgw-00007 strangers might ask each other for a sip of water
rev1-rGfhahVBIQw-00001 and this leads to oddities
rev1-rGfhahVBIQw-00002 but this is the source of innovation
rev1-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00001 well why is that
rev1-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00002 now i will maintain
rev1-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00005 what difference does it make if they talk like jerry seinfeld
rev1-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00006 i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
rev1-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00007 well what difference does this make
rev1-rSSanSYZDT4-00001 and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive
rev1-rSSanSYZDT4-00002 what makes the heart unique
rev1-rZCxdbqMc2Q-00001 i will be back
rev1-rftagV38YKY-00001 i didn't know where i was
rev1-s0YjL9rZyR0-00003 this is not a put down of anyone
rev1-s0YjL9rZyR0-00004 it is wrong
rev1-s0YjL9rZyR0-00005 it is irresponsible
rev1-s0YjL9rZyR0-00007 are we brave enough to welcome it
rev1-s0YjL9rZyR0-00008 but it's different
rev1-s4smjT1qwZU-00002 there's no structure
rev1-sVtIuDKFO1c-00001 getting a college education is a 20 year investment
rev1-sVtIuDKFO1c-00003 when you grow up poor you want to be rich
rev1-shG0ezBeeJc-00001 how could i let them down
rev1-shG0ezBeeJc-00002 sometimes it's messy and it's always unpredictable
rev1-stngBN4hp14-00001 about a year after 9 11 researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world
rev1-sxnlvwprfSc-00001 i teach at stanford
rev1-sxnlvwprfSc-00002 i'm a physician practicing with cutting edge technology
rev1-sxnlvwprfSc-00003 we're losing a ritual
rev1-sxnlvwprfSc-00007 this is when i was in texas
rev1-sxnlvwprfSc-00008 they had her scanned inside out
rev1-sxnlvwprfSc-00011 i would listen to the heart
rev1-t2gbcVaZ448-00002 after all i was a bit unconventional
rev1-t2gbcVaZ448-00003 i've struggled to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them
rev1-t2gbcVaZ448-00004 what if i had told her my story years ago
rev1-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00001 so you want to go to that board meeting but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest
rev1-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00002 that robot put on a great show
rev1-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00004 we almost don't feel ourselves
rev1-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00005 so what do we do
rev1-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00006 we connect more and more
rev1-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00007 when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
rev1-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00008 and that's what i'm calling for here now
rev1-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00009 do the same thing at work
rev1-ta2Wvy9FSgA-00001 that's pretty cool
rev1-ta2Wvy9FSgA-00002 we have the plan
rev1-ta2Wvy9FSgA-00003 but if they don't stay in paris the international pressure will be overwhelming
rev1-tbSWdVA4Sbo-00001 we might say then well let's not worry about this
rev1-tgSCwQwYNjc-00001 women's day was coming up
rev1-tiSiSM3pk5M-00002 well let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
rev1-tiSiSM3pk5M-00003 what can i do about it
rev1-tiSiSM3pk5M-00005 it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it
rev1-tiSiSM3pk5M-00009 you've broken your back
rev1-tiSiSM3pk5M-00010 you'll never walk again
rev1-tiSiSM3pk5M-00012 it's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away
rev1-tzJYY2p0QIc-00001 growing up i was always intrigued by how people change
rev1-tzJYY2p0QIc-00003 that's not to say it's impossible
rev1-u4L130DkdOw-00001 and how is that possible
rev1-uJr4wGcLNsA-00001 she never wanted to tell me
rev1-uJr4wGcLNsA-00003 my parents came from germany
rev1-uJr4wGcLNsA-00005 some of them were really afraid of contagion and they wouldn't even walk in front of our
rev1-uJr4wGcLNsA-00007 so what was i going to do
rev1-uJr4wGcLNsA-00009 constance baker motley
rev1-uJr4wGcLNsA-00010 that is the right answer
rev1-uL5XUwfkxZw-00002 and work like a dog
rev1-uL5XUwfkxZw-00003 that's your grandfather
rev1-uL5XUwfkxZw-00004 tell me about that
rev1-uL5XUwfkxZw-00006 and that's all
rev1-uL5XUwfkxZw-00007 they were all white
rev1-uL5XUwfkxZw-00008 so they felt safe to come there
rev1-uL5XUwfkxZw-00011 we didn't understand the program
rev1-uL5XUwfkxZw-00013 i said we work together
rev1-uL5XUwfkxZw-00015 i may never go to your house you may never come to my house
rev1-uqS6T6TAu74-00001 i became a psychology researcher and i've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
rev1-uzKBGtf0i0M-00002 and it is important
rev1-uzKBGtf0i0M-00004 without it we literally can't interface with others
rev1-uzKBGtf0i0M-00005 my history wasn't right
rev1-uzKBGtf0i0M-00007 my desire to disappear was still very powerful
rev1-uzKBGtf0i0M-00008 i take it to therapy
rev1-vGX3FASrQq4-00001 thank you very much
rev1-vXPJVwwEmiM-00001 he's at a technology conference in florida
rev1-vXPJVwwEmiM-00004 you probably won't
rev1-vXPJVwwEmiM-00005 nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
rev1-vXPJVwwEmiM-00006 most independent media was shut down
rev1-vXPJVwwEmiM-00007 we have to fix the internet
rev1-vXPJVwwEmiM-00008 we have to fix our education
rev1-vhVWzkbAW4I-00002 it showed no blockages
rev1-vhVWzkbAW4I-00003 but linda was lucky
rev1-vhVWzkbAW4I-00004 she found us we found her disease
rev1-vhVWzkbAW4I-00005 but for too many women that's not the case
rev1-vhVWzkbAW4I-00007 the authors looked at papers written over a 10 year period and hundreds had to be thrown out
rev1-vhVWzkbAW4I-00008 we know that every cell has a sex
rev1-vhVWzkbAW4I-00011 we have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum
rev1-vhVWzkbAW4I-00012 and it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine
rev1-w1R4F9sSoow-00001 we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just iraq and afghanistan
rev1-w1R4F9sSoow-00003 we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own work
rev1-w1R4F9sSoow-00005 i do believe we can fix what's broken
rev1-w1R4F9sSoow-00006 we all want to
rev1-wG4RnDNWtJo-00001 that was a huge problem at the haiti earthquake
rev1-wG4RnDNWtJo-00003 we lost valuable data
rev1-wG4RnDNWtJo-00004 it's about the data
rev1-wGMLhaa98GI-00001 i can hardly wait
rev1-wKlMcLTqRLs-00001 why did my child develop autism
rev1-wlR1ojoiue0-00001 they were wonderful people
rev1-wlR1ojoiue0-00004 this is possible
rev1-wlR1ojoiue0-00005 the world's companies governments and non profits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this
rev1-wmMrZyVANUo-00001 and in many cases we don't
rev1-wmMrZyVANUo-00002 but we all should
rev1-wmMrZyVANUo-00003 this will pay dividends
rev1-wzkFoetpSSM-00002 i feel that god knows me
rev1-wzkFoetpSSM-00004 and i thought we should just stay home
rev1-wzkFoetpSSM-00005 the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
rev1-wzkFoetpSSM-00007 so we decided to go to the mosque
rev1-x4m6j7rSyzY-00001 i know it works
rev1-x95nwilkaio-00001 but i grew up in canada far from my arab roots
rev1-x95nwilkaio-00002 they have been sold by their families often to wealthy arab tourists
rev1-x95nwilkaio-00003 this is just one face of a booming sex trade across the arab region
rev1-x95nwilkaio-00005 social change doesn't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation
rev1-xFSCX9mAHPo-00001 we're not playing with each other
rev1-xFSCX9mAHPo-00002 there's a million different ways to eat pizza
rev1-xFSCX9mAHPo-00003 if we're still hungry we might have some more
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00004 all of you are members of tribes
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00007 you don't want this
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00008 this is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00009 and i want to make the point that as members of society we need to
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00012 if you want this experience to live on as something historic then at the reception
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00014 but we're not done yet
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00015 it comes out of a place called the gallup organization
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00016 you know they do polls right
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00019 pretty much everybody else who does polls
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00020 so i'd like to leave you with these thoughts
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00021 the group gels
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00023 but you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00024 there was no road map
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00025 in fact south africa has not gone down that road
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00027 life is great
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00031 what about martin luther king
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00034 and he grew up essentially in stage one
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00035 my life really sucks
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00036 i don't know anybody
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00038 but i don't
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00039 you're hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people a tribe about how
rev1-xTkKSJSqUSI-00040 and you don't leave them where they are
rev1-xkFTZcUPjBg-00001 i was going through a hard time as well
rev1-xkFTZcUPjBg-00002 i was like what
rev1-xkFTZcUPjBg-00003 what about you
rev1-xlUPlxSpDRo-00001 you don't have to bring any quarters because the washer and dryer are free
rev1-xukDIWFMU9Y-00002 look at this pretty structure
rev1-xukDIWFMU9Y-00003 has a coherent movement
rev1-y1KIVZw7Jxk-00003 that's not an improbable sample
rev1-y1KIVZw7Jxk-00004 you can navigate space
rev1-y1KIVZw7Jxk-00005 you know about numbers
rev1-y6MC4iXhT6I-00001 we're looking for something more
rev1-yMWlkJAqKYU-00001 how is that possible
rev1-yNhu0MGS2MA-00001 why not just let businesses compete
rev1-yeVz0rtXCmw-00001 i started to walk in the community and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't
rev1-yeVz0rtXCmw-00004 we had law enforcement partners
rev1-yeVz0rtXCmw-00005 they need support
rev1-zL2FOrx41N0-00001 how does it happen
rev1-zMGE3mbS9NY-00001 at the same time
rev1-zuYzOn0U2PY-00001 it's a fucking orgy
rev1-zuYzOn0U2PY-00002 how is it made
rev1-zuYzOn0U2PY-00003 why was it made
rev1-zuYzOn0U2PY-00005 they feel at home
rev2-0Fi83BHQsMA-00002 we really don't walk anymore
rev2-0Fi83BHQsMA-00004 at some point i'm going to get out
rev2-0Fi83BHQsMA-00005 when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
rev2-0Fi83BHQsMA-00006 we'd love to help
rev2-0QVXdEOiCw8-00001 i wasn't very good at reading things
rev2-0VJqrlH9cdI-00001 and he said on the spot absolutely yes
rev2-0VJqrlH9cdI-00002 he was smiling and we said go
rev2-0ZfSOArXbGQ-00001 we said yes
rev2-0ZfSOArXbGQ-00002 we were so excited
rev2-0ZfSOArXbGQ-00003 and so one of the major challenges of our project really is to find photographs that were taken before something
rev2-0gks6ceq4eQ-00002 not what is it
rev2-0gks6ceq4eQ-00005 predictions are the basis of every experience that you have
rev2-0gks6ceq4eQ-00006 they are the basis of every action that you take
rev2-0gks6ceq4eQ-00007 it's using past experience based on similar situations to try to make meaning
rev2-0gks6ceq4eQ-00008 and so how does your brain give you that detail
rev2-0gks6ceq4eQ-00009 well that's what predictions are
rev2-0gks6ceq4eQ-00010 i'm totally serious
rev2-0gks6ceq4eQ-00013 i know i have
rev2-0gks6ceq4eQ-00015 so when you're born you can make feelings like calmness and
rev2-0iIh5YYDR2o-00001 i'm not a social problem guy
rev2-18uDutylDa4-00001 i feel guilty sometimes
rev2-18uDutylDa4-00002 so i'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone
rev2-18uDutylDa4-00004 boy it matters a lot
rev2-18uDutylDa4-00007 what do you mean
rev2-18uDutylDa4-00009 your job needs to be challenging
rev2-18uDutylDa4-00010 he's a great guy
rev2-18uDutylDa4-00011 you want to work for him
rev2-1K5SycZjGhI-00001 blocks have names
rev2-1L6lSFiV4xo-00002 you just have to find another term and look that up
rev2-1L6lSFiV4xo-00003 i do like magic
rev2-1PNX6MSdVsk-00001 i don't have an overview
rev2-1PNX6MSdVsk-00005 more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
rev2-1PNX6MSdVsk-00007 trust is the response
rev2-1PNX6MSdVsk-00009 we can do it two people together trying to improve trust
rev2-1PNX6MSdVsk-00010 because it's given by other people
rev2-1PNX6MSdVsk-00011 let me give you a simple commercial example
rev2-1US4jjWtua8-00001 we're going to eat these cows
rev2-1US4jjWtua8-00002 they're not being shipped up here
rev2-1US4jjWtua8-00004 it's not optional
rev2-1US4jjWtua8-00005 it's not a luxury
rev2-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00001 we've done the research
rev2-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00004 she had to impersonate a man
rev2-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00005 mortality is not going down it's going up
rev2-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00006 and not enough is being done about this
rev2-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00007 it told us about hormone replacement therapy
rev2-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00011 women are worth it
rev2-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00013 so what do you think happens to these gals
rev2-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00014 they're often not recognized sent home
rev2-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00015 i'm not sure what it was
rev2-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00017 well once again women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem
rev2-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00020 and we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years
rev2-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00021 and in fact it probably won't
rev2-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00022 so we have these feast and famine cycles
rev2-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00023 so thank you for your attention
rev2-27lMmdmySb8-00001 everybody focuses on the things that kill us and that's what i was focusing on
rev2-27lMmdmySb8-00002 and they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants
rev2-27lMmdmySb8-00005 actually studied hormones
rev2-27lMmdmySb8-00006 we can't see it most of the time
rev2-27lMmdmySb8-00008 and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases
rev2-2SlBiFZ85d0-00002 i have three sons so i see how they fight
rev2-2SlBiFZ85d0-00003 we're not just part of the same species
rev2-2SlBiFZ85d0-00004 we're part of the same family
rev2-2SlBiFZ85d0-00006 and i won't name names but you know who you are
rev2-2SlBiFZ85d0-00008 so that's what i'm doing
rev2-2UStOghblfE-00001 why are we embedded in social networks
rev2-2UStOghblfE-00002 i mean how do they form
rev2-2UStOghblfE-00003 how do they operate
rev2-2UStOghblfE-00004 how far do they reach
rev2-2UStOghblfE-00005 and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother
rev2-3A1LvXRnpVg-00001 give me input
rev2-3OgsRa7VDtI-00001 they can't get what they need when they need it
rev2-3OgsRa7VDtI-00003 that's the status quo today
rev2-3OgsRa7VDtI-00004 gov just six people
rev2-3OgsRa7VDtI-00008 yes it's hard
rev2-3nSEitPb7BU-00001 but it wasn't just individuals
rev2-3r1IPsldbBg-00002 well there's a self fulfilling prophecy
rev2-3r1IPsldbBg-00003 we shouldn't be nationalistic
rev2-3uSQlcGCHUU-00001 this economy won't work and thomas jefferson saying the people won't trust that
rev2-3uSQlcGCHUU-00006 but that system has tons of problems
rev2-3uSQlcGCHUU-00008 wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive
rev2-3uSQlcGCHUU-00011 but that is not the case at all
rev2-3uSQlcGCHUU-00012 or do you think the government should redistribute
rev2-3uSQlcGCHUU-00014 and nothing happened at all
rev2-3uSQlcGCHUU-00015 so i'm in the media
rev2-3uSQlcGCHUU-00016 they don't represent what our views are
rev2-3uSQlcGCHUU-00017 we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton
rev2-3vfuCPFb8wk-00001 but it's more complicated
rev2-3zqZPujAPuc-00001 so no more missing guys
rev2-48xS00Iy0ac-00002 buildings can be like people
rev2-48xS00Iy0ac-00003 their faces broadcast their experience
rev2-4AYE3w5TWHs-00004 and then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues
rev2-4AYE3w5TWHs-00005 so just like with a bike we don't talk about it
rev2-4AYE3w5TWHs-00006 you can try it
rev2-4ErEBkjS3PY-00001 i'm a professor and we're passionate about education
rev2-4Q2aznfmcYU-00001 now don't get me wrong
rev2-4Q2aznfmcYU-00002 of course they would
rev2-4n8qT0vQbWk-00001 but this is what i heard from a lot of outraged people
rev2-4n8qT0vQbWk-00003 we have to decide what it means
rev2-4v4XxlfVk3o-00001 this is completely bizarre
rev2-55yGmKc6WfE-00001 they're looking and looking and finding love
rev2-5Knz100ldLM-00001 we can open up city hall
rev2-5P04stEjJ9E-00003 i'm not a military brat
rev2-5P04stEjJ9E-00004 they signed up because they wanted some form of revenge
rev2-5P04stEjJ9E-00005 one was to be a soldier
rev2-5P04stEjJ9E-00006 the other was to be a baseball player
rev2-5Yj3nGv0kn8-00001 are you losing your mind
rev2-5Yj3nGv0kn8-00002 so let's watch what happens
rev2-5b5BDoddOLA-00001 so that was easy
rev2-5b5BDoddOLA-00002 we weren't considered the real thing
rev2-5b5BDoddOLA-00004 and the way to do it is through the bloodstream
rev2-5ifMRNag2XU-00001 i want to be the center of attention
rev2-5riPKdpuoiI-00002 did you find the gold
rev2-62cNtvx6P8E-00001 i could make that decision
rev2-66koScWSHBU-00001 and the problem that we're solving is what are those things
rev2-66koScWSHBU-00003 they won the game
rev2-66koScWSHBU-00005 so bear with me
rev2-66koScWSHBU-00006 thank you very much
rev2-6OaIdwUdSxE-00003 make me laugh
rev2-6Waurx8eS1o-00001 how can somebody like that make you feel smart
rev2-6Waurx8eS1o-00003 he made me feel smart
rev2-6Waurx8eS1o-00008 you saw him act
rev2-6kHSuYwt0qs-00002 we don't use audio we don't use video
rev2-6ra1MIKlYB0-00002 how are you
rev2-6wNif5SlN08-00001 the boys reminded me of home
rev2-6wNif5SlN08-00005 i didn't want to
rev2-6wNif5SlN08-00007 i said in arabic
rev2-6wNif5SlN08-00010 after college i desperately needed to find a place to call home
rev2-6wNif5SlN08-00011 1 percent who get to do that
rev2-6wNif5SlN08-00012 they had hit the jackpot
rev2-6wNif5SlN08-00013 life is good
rev2-6wNif5SlN08-00014 it wasn't like them to miss practice
rev2-7OMLSs8t1ng-00001 i do understand it
rev2-7OMLSs8t1ng-00002 doesn't happen very much
rev2-7OMLSs8t1ng-00007 i don't know
rev2-7OMLSs8t1ng-00010 you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases
rev2-7OMLSs8t1ng-00012 what about polio
rev2-7OMLSs8t1ng-00013 let's have that
rev2-7OMLSs8t1ng-00014 no one's ever said that before
rev2-7OMLSs8t1ng-00017 we don't trust the man
rev2-7OMLSs8t1ng-00018 it has to stop
rev2-7OMLSs8t1ng-00019 it's a debate about words about metaphors
rev2-7ZymFMmpOa0-00002 but in fact they found something very surprising
rev2-7ZymFMmpOa0-00005 we used to have a manufacturing economy which was about building goods and products and now we have a service
rev2-7ZymFMmpOa0-00006 but that really isn't true anymore
rev2-7ZymFMmpOa0-00007 you would be issuing orders from above
rev2-7ZymFMmpOa0-00009 this is a real mystery
rev2-7ZymFMmpOa0-00011 and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
rev2-7gXq1ml6B1E-00001 it's natural connective tissue
rev2-7gkdzkVbuVA-00001 originally the sample was aged 18 to 94
rev2-7gkdzkVbuVA-00003 how sad are you right now
rev2-7gkdzkVbuVA-00004 how frustrated are you right now
rev2-7gkdzkVbuVA-00005 we take less notice of trivial matters
rev2-7hQ0rgVfsP8-00001 well i was surprised
rev2-7hQ0rgVfsP8-00002 i did not know this
rev2-7kkRkhAXZGg-00003 now in all seriousness movies are actually really important
rev2-7kkRkhAXZGg-00004 storytelling is so important
rev2-7kkRkhAXZGg-00006 stories are amazing
rev2-7kkRkhAXZGg-00007 but what does
rev2-7kkRkhAXZGg-00010 what would happen
rev2-7nZqiPLCvM4-00001 you don't do much editing
rev2-7qT3RpaBlJo-00001 it is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least
rev2-7qT3RpaBlJo-00002 one you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is
rev2-7uN4I1wEOXE-00001 i have to take a year off
rev2-81Ub0SMxZQo-00001 i'm talking about teachers
rev2-81Ub0SMxZQo-00002 how would i know what i was doing differently
rev2-81Ub0SMxZQo-00003 so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
rev2-87AEeLpodnE-00001 they supported me all the way through it
rev2-87AEeLpodnE-00002 something was wrong
rev2-87AEeLpodnE-00004 has it gotten better
rev2-87AEeLpodnE-00005 that's something we ought to celebrate
rev2-87AEeLpodnE-00008 irreconcilable differences right
rev2-87AEeLpodnE-00010 we're blessed with people who listen to us
rev2-8GQZuzIdeQQ-00001 it wasn't who i was
rev2-8GQZuzIdeQQ-00004 here's where i stand
rev2-8HfoKd873HY-00001 i tried everything
rev2-8K9Gg164Bsw-00001 what a contradiction
rev2-8UhqkX2VAmo-00001 otherwise millions more will die
rev2-8VwTZFYSfvw-00001 i don't even know if it's a real job title to be honest
rev2-8VwTZFYSfvw-00002 it was the coldest i've ever been
rev2-8Z24LCysq3A-00001 one thousand eight hundred and thirty six people died
rev2-8iSpNVj5KMw-00001 he got part time i
rev2-8iSpNVj5KMw-00002 i forgive you and i do not hate you
rev2-8mPpe8AL21A-00001 because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group
rev2-8nbeD1mwCdo-00001 does the water stay there forever
rev2-8nt3edWLgIg-00001 we don't need moore's law to continue
rev2-8nt3edWLgIg-00003 we just need to keep going
rev2-8nt3edWLgIg-00004 we have problems that we desperately need to solve
rev2-8nt3edWLgIg-00005 i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of artificial intelligence
rev2-8vNIrPeRGlM-00001 it cracked open my world
rev2-8vNIrPeRGlM-00003 so they won't go for a walk they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat
rev2-8vNIrPeRGlM-00005 she would hide in the closet
rev2-8vNIrPeRGlM-00009 they want to know how often your dog gets outside
rev2-8vNIrPeRGlM-00010 they want to know how much exercise your dog is getting
rev2-8vNIrPeRGlM-00011 his name is lonnie hodge and he's a veteran of vietnam
rev2-95ovIJ3dsNk-00002 for hepatitis it was also two and a half times
rev2-95ovIJ3dsNk-00003 for depression it was four and a half times
rev2-95ovIJ3dsNk-00005 what kind of trauma am i talking about here
rev2-95ovIJ3dsNk-00006 children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
rev2-95ovIJ3dsNk-00009 well imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear
rev2-9B0PaSznWJE-00002 so thank you very much
rev2-9CqVYUOjHLw-00002 it's the war on terror
rev2-9JKy6ZfmBn0-00001 you don't get a chance to mess it up
rev2-9JKy6ZfmBn0-00002 one of them got caught up in the water
rev2-9RMx31GnNXY-00001 plus we have stem cells
rev2-9RMx31GnNXY-00002 i was able to do more things
rev2-9RMx31GnNXY-00003 i know i was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery
rev2-9RMx31GnNXY-00004 and when i was 10 i didn't realize how amazing it was
rev2-9TPFLHvn024-00002 there were no back doors
rev2-9YekkGz1E2k-00001 i had to do something
rev2-9YekkGz1E2k-00002 this fishing village was famous for sculpture
rev2-9kBKQS7J7xI-00001 i don't paint
rev2-9kBKQS7J7xI-00002 this is going to become really freaking obvious
rev2-9uOMectkCCs-00001 dan replies so often you won't even notice it
rev2-9uOMectkCCs-00002 and then something falls off the wall
rev2-9uOMectkCCs-00004 we all know what he's talking about
rev2-9uOMectkCCs-00005 that wasn't the case for me
rev2-9uOMectkCCs-00007 no more charge before use
rev2-AMVgX8cXsHA-00002 and that's bad
rev2-AO4In7d6XSc-00001 what about manipulation
rev2-AO4In7d6XSc-00002 so that's mobile manipulation
rev2-AO4In7d6XSc-00003 i love building robots
rev2-AWPrOvzzqZk-00002 and when you think about it it makes a lot of sense because forming a question is a really complex
rev2-AegIbt2j0sU-00001 and they also knew that they can tap into a workforce
rev2-AsSd2nmoKNA-00001 i tagged along with my neighbors
rev2-AsSd2nmoKNA-00002 and i said to myself i wanna get me one of them
rev2-AsSd2nmoKNA-00003 who wrote that
rev2-AsSd2nmoKNA-00004 i'll meet you there
rev2-B8rmi95pYL0-00002 the key here really is knowledge
rev2-BHY0FxzoKZE-00002 i tried everything
rev2-BHY0FxzoKZE-00003 maybe i did an experiment on myself without even knowing it
rev2-BImnT7lcLDE-00001 you just had to do things sometimes
rev2-BImnT7lcLDE-00002 and boy they were like what
rev2-BImnT7lcLDE-00003 how do you get to build those relationships
rev2-BImnT7lcLDE-00004 so we created a new school
rev2-BImnT7lcLDE-00006 but that doesn't mean that we can't
rev2-BQZKs75RMqM-00001 it's almost becoming the syntax of a new language
rev2-BhMKmovNjvc-00001 on the other hand statistics that's a subject that you could and should use
rev2-Bo8YN3oB0Cw-00002 this is what i'm supposed to naturally be able to do
rev2-Bo8YN3oB0Cw-00003 why is it not working
rev2-Bs86giWcjLA-00001 and you know what
rev2-Bs86giWcjLA-00002 they were right
rev2-Bs86giWcjLA-00004 it brings people together and it supports creativity and social cohesion
rev2-BvpmZktlBFs-00002 did you hear he has gone mad
rev2-BzeTjn0R2VY-00001 i mean everyone did
rev2-BzeTjn0R2VY-00003 again it will not happen overnight
rev2-BzeTjn0R2VY-00004 it needs to happen
rev2-CDsNZJTWw0w-00001 i have resources
rev2-CdZJ0SMbh10-00001 and is this really the solution
rev2-CgNx9Bgac1I-00002 so i went to my doctor
rev2-CgNx9Bgac1I-00003 but i'm not happy
rev2-ClfBxWPkBKU-00001 in other words a coroner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe
rev2-ClfBxWPkBKU-00003 and remember we had experience with this
rev2-ClfBxWPkBKU-00005 roughly 300 savings and loans involved roughly 600 senior officials
rev2-ClfBxWPkBKU-00008 that is not simply critical to our economy
rev2-ClfBxWPkBKU-00009 thank you very much
rev2-ClfBxWPkBKU-00010 what do we need to do
rev2-ClfBxWPkBKU-00011 what can we do in all of this
rev2-CxEqV8WtfOo-00001 i'm 27 years old
rev2-D8SSLLnV3W8-00001 that's more expensive
rev2-DCIL2nvU4x8-00001 and when we do the results will often surprise
rev2-DDaldVHUedI-00002 i wanted to stay in this relationship
rev2-DDaldVHUedI-00003 things were going well
rev2-DDaldVHUedI-00004 this is a really important chapter to me
rev2-DDaldVHUedI-00005 why are we skipping over this
rev2-DDaldVHUedI-00006 i went to the dean
rev2-DOgsYATbVSs-00001 but here's the thing
rev2-DOgsYATbVSs-00003 it's not like teaching them how to ride a bike
rev2-DOgsYATbVSs-00004 i don't know
rev2-DjeIpjhAqsM-00002 and that led me to this project
rev2-DjeIpjhAqsM-00003 we have to turn that around
rev2-DsrxbqFo41k-00002 so i went to church as often as i could
rev2-E0oPnS7rUwE-00001 it's a performance venue
rev2-E0oPnS7rUwE-00002 but it's not enough
rev2-E0oPnS7rUwE-00003 and they're not just focused on money
rev2-E0oPnS7rUwE-00006 i've built a career
rev2-E0oPnS7rUwE-00007 we are magic
rev2-E22icGCvGXk-00001 they're completely flat and they're basically cardboard characters
rev2-E22icGCvGXk-00004 i got about 3000 emails
rev2-E22icGCvGXk-00006 my own website
rev2-EGjxIS5MPUY-00001 it's always what it was and what it can be
rev2-EV3OmxrowWE-00001 they're not my children
rev2-EV3OmxrowWE-00003 and when we're unprepared we overreact
rev2-EV3OmxrowWE-00004 and i did not know what to say
rev2-EV3OmxrowWE-00007 we can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate locate
rev2-F3OhcpKSUBc-00001 and looking at that pattern
rev2-F3OhcpKSUBc-00004 he saw it written down somewhere
rev2-F3OhcpKSUBc-00006 and now we want to do a double double of the age wave coming through
rev2-F3OhcpKSUBc-00007 that's sort of the state of the art
rev2-F5h6ynoq8uM-00001 what's this guy talking about
rev2-F5h6ynoq8uM-00002 let me illustrate this
rev2-FD6CqD1kV8s-00001 and he's a bad guy
rev2-FD6CqD1kV8s-00003 there were others like myself who were full time
rev2-FD6CqD1kV8s-00004 it's not a dirty word
rev2-FD6CqD1kV8s-00005 the children were killed on the spot
rev2-FFG2rilqT2g-00003 well you get several things
rev2-FFG2rilqT2g-00004 the gas that they used at first in many cases was oxygen
rev2-FFG2rilqT2g-00005 so they added oxygen to methane gas
rev2-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00001 so what is an idea drawing
rev2-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00002 here i'm one person talking to you
rev2-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00003 you're all collective
rev2-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00007 and if it's completely okay what's the joke
rev2-FQEEMpzPZlY-00001 they change from person to person
rev2-FcmSmAwPkxg-00001 we've all done this
rev2-FcmSmAwPkxg-00005 when it's 10 degrees below zero
rev2-FcmSmAwPkxg-00006 there's love and there's friendship and there's protection
rev2-FcmSmAwPkxg-00007 you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive doses of chemotherapy
rev2-FcmSmAwPkxg-00008 we see it as a disruption of real life and important work
rev2-FcmSmAwPkxg-00010 she suffered so much
rev2-FcmSmAwPkxg-00012 could we merge
rev2-Fivy99RtMfM-00002 that's awful right
rev2-FmpIMt95ndU-00001 sort of leadership by humiliation
rev2-FmpIMt95ndU-00004 thanks for asking
rev2-FmpIMt95ndU-00005 i said where is he now
rev2-FqrLUtIFVjs-00001 so how does this work
rev2-FqrLUtIFVjs-00002 we change the economics for the bad guys
rev2-FxtSMZKMdes-00002 we have the right to respect
rev2-FxtSMZKMdes-00004 i'm a feminist but i'm a rather bad one
rev2-FxtSMZKMdes-00005 i am full of contradictions
rev2-FxtSMZKMdes-00006 i want no part of any of that
rev2-FxtSMZKMdes-00007 i enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things
rev2-FxtSMZKMdes-00009 we go far beyond reasonable constructive criticism to dissecting any given woman's feminism
rev2-FxtSMZKMdes-00010 they are gorgeous and headstrong brilliant girls who are a whole lot of brave
rev2-FxtSMZKMdes-00014 some boys broke me when i was so young i did not know what boys can do to break a girl
rev2-FxtSMZKMdes-00015 i learned to write like them and then i learned to write as myself
rev2-FxtSMZKMdes-00017 i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such bravery
rev2-G2XBIkHW954-00002 we're seeing the baby brain
rev2-GAMR5RDSLJo-00005 lots of money
rev2-GAMR5RDSLJo-00006 supporting local economies
rev2-GAMR5RDSLJo-00007 it's a top predator
rev2-GAMR5RDSLJo-00009 i love red wine
rev2-GAMR5RDSLJo-00010 i'm going to be so healthy
rev2-GAMR5RDSLJo-00011 i want to know how i impact them
rev2-GAMR5RDSLJo-00014 i want to know how they impact me
rev2-GAMR5RDSLJo-00016 so let's start there
rev2-GAMR5RDSLJo-00018 i made more money
rev2-GAMR5RDSLJo-00019 this is great
rev2-GAMR5RDSLJo-00020 we've seen an image of our blue planet our world bank
rev2-GGScU5ESei4-00001 but there's actually more to the story than that
rev2-GGScU5ESei4-00004 what's different is how the molecules are put together
rev2-GGScU5ESei4-00005 the oil will never run out
rev2-GIbz9ms9Z9k-00001 you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might go wrong
rev2-GIbz9ms9Z9k-00003 they want a treatment
rev2-GIbz9ms9Z9k-00004 we are all responsible
rev2-GMynksvCcUI-00001 my father worked at this factory he said
rev2-GMynksvCcUI-00002 my grandfather worked at this factory
rev2-GMynksvCcUI-00008 why not ask all of the states to do that instead
rev2-GMynksvCcUI-00009 and imagine what might happen because every region has something to offer
rev2-GSf6nijSSdA-00002 i've tried engaging people
rev2-GSf6nijSSdA-00003 and he surprised me by saying you know what
rev2-GSf6nijSSdA-00004 patriarchy is not boys and men
rev2-GSf6nijSSdA-00005 that allowed me to take a stand for myself
rev2-GSf6nijSSdA-00007 i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse including three
rev2-GSf6nijSSdA-00010 and guess what silicon valley
rev2-GSf6nijSSdA-00011 so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
rev2-GZadCj8O1S0-00001 so that's it for now
rev2-Gmai4zkKNcM-00001 it came from the way in which beijing has grown as a city
rev2-Gmai4zkKNcM-00002 that's really important
rev2-Gmai4zkKNcM-00003 and we couldn't just turn it off
rev2-Gmai4zkKNcM-00004 you're in there
rev2-Gmai4zkKNcM-00006 but the second of the transformations the climate transformations we have to decide to do
rev2-Gmai4zkKNcM-00007 we can see how to do that
rev2-GqnJFm1CS3c-00002 don't get me wrong it's not like we don't have comedy in the middle east
rev2-GvGAIGbnX7E-00001 they have to be able to teach us something as well
rev2-GvGAIGbnX7E-00004 and in that i need a surgery lexicon
rev2-H14bBuluwB8-00001 my research team and i went to west point military academy
rev2-H14bBuluwB8-00002 that's the work that stands before us
rev2-H9ZOpQzjukY-00001 we're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
rev2-HD4bpztESWw-00001 we're on the grid
rev2-HI7zfpitZpo-00002 who or what inspires you and why
rev2-HSercnrqeN4-00001 i exist because i have my women friends
rev2-HSercnrqeN4-00002 i don't know about you
rev2-HSercnrqeN4-00004 and guess what
rev2-HUM2rCIUdeI-00001 i looked at slaves
rev2-HUM2rCIUdeI-00003 there's no need to play the market
rev2-HUM2rCIUdeI-00004 it's not a lot of money at the global level
rev2-HbUeAdVXOVc-00001 this is the only part that's battery backed up
rev2-HdwOlk6HIVc-00001 and germany and france
rev2-HdwOlk6HIVc-00002 4 times the mass of the sun
rev2-HdwOlk6HIVc-00004 surely we know enough
rev2-HiwJ0hNl1Fw-00002 the same tool that united us to topple dictators
rev2-HiwJ0hNl1Fw-00003 i was terrified
rev2-Hj9oB4zpHww-00001 what is worth dying for
rev2-Hj9oB4zpHww-00003 that is what it is to have a domain of expertise
rev2-HqekWfSJCSA-00002 we can change our minds
rev2-Ht2fzax9wV0-00001 you need to be able to do something with it
rev2-Ht2fzax9wV0-00002 we're always trying to make it faster
rev2-IPBCxlxSSVk-00001 we will not be there
rev2-IS4IK8CiLg8-00001 what is that
rev2-IS4IK8CiLg8-00002 she contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work
rev2-IThAD5yKrgE-00001 it's not exactly rocket science
rev2-IWdzrZdRa38-00001 it's changed the way we talk
rev2-IWdzrZdRa38-00004 the board of ed
rev2-IWdzrZdRa38-00005 had no idea
rev2-IWdzrZdRa38-00006 they don't trust the law
rev2-IWdzrZdRa38-00007 why don't they trust the law
rev2-IWdzrZdRa38-00012 it's not true
rev2-IjbTiRbeNpM-00001 that was the only way to get anything done
rev2-IjbTiRbeNpM-00002 that's available right now
rev2-IjbTiRbeNpM-00003 art is not efficient
rev2-IjbTiRbeNpM-00004 human relationships are not efficient
rev2-IjbTiRbeNpM-00005 efficiency is for robots
rev2-Ip2SQa50uBI-00001 china is the world's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades
rev2-Ip2SQa50uBI-00003 how else can we create new ideas
rev2-Ip2SQa50uBI-00005 but some of our grandchildren probably will
rev2-J8FyHI00ELY-00001 that's what happened with my dad
rev2-J8FyHI00ELY-00002 my dad has alzheimer's disease
rev2-J8FyHI00ELY-00004 they get scared to walk around
rev2-J8FyHI00ELY-00005 they get scared to move
rev2-J8FyHI00ELY-00006 i'm trying to become a better person
rev2-J8FyHI00ELY-00008 even when it's so hard
rev2-J8FyHI00ELY-00009 and what i need now is to learn to be like that
rev2-JFQLvbVJVMg-00001 so this is obvious right
rev2-JFQLvbVJVMg-00003 so what's women's experience as it relates to mentoring
rev2-JHk9YVjhk7c-00001 is it that i write very well
rev2-JISHzvXk5bk-00001 quite the opposite
rev2-JP0w9lZoLwU-00002 thank you very much
rev2-JSSc7hYKstI-00005 especially when it comes to climate change
rev2-JSSc7hYKstI-00006 so i want to talk to you today about what i think is a much more complete recipe for deep
rev2-JSSc7hYKstI-00007 this meant that the movements demanding change knew what they were against crushing poverty widening
rev2-JSSc7hYKstI-00008 progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
rev2-JSSc7hYKstI-00010 well very often we think about political change in defined compartments these days
rev2-JSSc7hYKstI-00014 what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what its core values are
rev2-JSSc7hYKstI-00015 a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish
rev2-JSSc7hYKstI-00016 so we locked ourselves in a room for two days and we tried to figure out what bound us together
rev2-JSSc7hYKstI-00017 well we rejected all of that
rev2-JSSc7hYKstI-00019 but in the process they also train our brains to tune out when somebody else's issue
rev2-JTN9Nx8VYtk-00002 i don't have an answer
rev2-Jc9RdbHEFa0-00001 i don't know
rev2-JcJ3MfJNm6g-00001 the science is there
rev2-Jm2dWbNsnZI-00001 let's think about your ethical footprint
rev2-Jm2dWbNsnZI-00002 but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
rev2-KNSRifMSSvM-00001 and he wanted one so badly
rev2-KPNn880KWfU-00003 which brings me to my second point
rev2-KPNn880KWfU-00005 i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
rev2-KuWXfjyGhk0-00001 a huge opportunity unleashing of new potential for innovation for development
rev2-KuWXfjyGhk0-00004 there will be invisible capacity
rev2-KuWXfjyGhk0-00005 but the question is who will have it
rev2-KuWXfjyGhk0-00007 of course migration will become even more important
rev2-KuWXfjyGhk0-00009 and this change is getting more rapid
rev2-KvvjDOtS2sw-00005 i didn't always succeed
rev2-KvvjDOtS2sw-00006 i hadn't bathed in three days
rev2-KvvjDOtS2sw-00007 why are you really here
rev2-KvvjDOtS2sw-00010 and i cried
rev2-KvvjDOtS2sw-00012 i was winning awards
rev2-KvvjDOtS2sw-00013 i was living in my own apartment
rev2-KvvjDOtS2sw-00014 i was no longer homeless
rev2-KxLMjn4WPBY-00001 race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences
rev2-KxLMjn4WPBY-00002 i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to
rev2-LEx6K4P4GJc-00001 i know platforms i know computers they put me on the internet when i was young
rev2-LEx6K4P4GJc-00003 what would that change about how we live
rev2-LEx6K4P4GJc-00004 what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
rev2-LEx6K4P4GJc-00005 a digital world farm
rev2-LEx6K4P4GJc-00010 why didn't you just tell me that
rev2-LHHlPnfOtRo-00001 well that's exciting
rev2-LIckScLypGA-00001 and dance has progressed
rev2-LIckScLypGA-00002 and this is happening every day
rev2-LIy2oVJtJsA-00002 they're not donated
rev2-LIy2oVJtJsA-00003 they're not heavily subsidized
rev2-LIy2oVJtJsA-00006 and use is what creates impact
rev2-LYCKzpXEW6E-00001 how could i come from a nation
rev2-LYCKzpXEW6E-00002 what kind of rituals are these
rev2-LYCKzpXEW6E-00003 the rituals were familiar
rev2-Li4S1yyrsTI-00001 why do i believe this
rev2-Li4S1yyrsTI-00003 and you know what else we did
rev2-Li4S1yyrsTI-00007 and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
rev2-Li4S1yyrsTI-00009 and so knowing that we went to the advertising council and we asked them to help us
rev2-Li4S1yyrsTI-00010 we were making what was invisible visible
rev2-Li4S1yyrsTI-00011 take a look at one of our spots
rev2-Li4S1yyrsTI-00013 and let me just put this in context
rev2-Li4S1yyrsTI-00014 we were obviously making a difference
rev2-Li4S1yyrsTI-00015 but we were still missing a critical element
rev2-Li4S1yyrsTI-00016 and that's what we did
rev2-Li4S1yyrsTI-00021 we met men where they were at and we built a program
rev2-Li4S1yyrsTI-00022 and he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving
rev2-LiUClSItcy0-00001 texting has a 100 percent open rate
rev2-LiUClSItcy0-00004 i think it might be a lifeline
rev2-LiUClSItcy0-00005 he told me not to tell anyone
rev2-LiUClSItcy0-00006 it's my dad
rev2-LiUClSItcy0-00007 that last one's an actual text message that we received
rev2-LiUClSItcy0-00008 i will not forget the day we got that text message
rev2-LiUClSItcy0-00009 and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline
rev2-LjAsM1vAhW0-00001 the nazis invaded the netherlands
rev2-LpROaNue9GM-00001 but when i was little i remember he would kill flies in our house with my bb gun
rev2-LujWrkYsl64-00002 it was like a star trek episode you know
rev2-M0SbSz5Le10-00002 i started off in uganda
rev2-M5PiTCwoQRo-00001 well not so fast
rev2-M6TMSQWI9m4-00001 i'm in tucson
rev2-M7KSnq0xkWY-00001 we have to throw it away
rev2-MIAS1xQc7x8-00002 we can do it again
rev2-MNuOmTQdFjA-00001 and i don't have to do anything
rev2-MNuOmTQdFjA-00002 so i looked for furniture
rev2-MsLuQM5V3FA-00001 my other great passion is the environment
rev2-MsLuQM5V3FA-00002 i was considered a radical
rev2-MsLuQM5V3FA-00005 so let's get started now
rev2-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00003 go i said again sweat forming on my brow
rev2-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00006 i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
rev2-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00007 science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writing
rev2-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00009 it was faulty and most of the time i had to restart it over and over before it worked
rev2-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00011 for africans homegrown science fiction can be a will to power
rev2-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00012 it is in the water
rev2-MvXZzKZ3JYQ-00001 my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach terminal cancer
rev2-NA7krbsdXFA-00002 we suspended our values
rev2-NA7krbsdXFA-00003 and what was the result of that
rev2-NA7krbsdXFA-00005 but it's not just china
rev2-NA7krbsdXFA-00010 where are the philosophers
rev2-NA7krbsdXFA-00011 and that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you
rev2-NCJTV5KaJJc-00001 last week alone i got 238 pieces of nasty email and more
rev2-NCJTV5KaJJc-00002 but i'm a big fan of you as a person
rev2-NL0uxDscjdo-00001 and so they took them to some safe place
rev2-NL0uxDscjdo-00004 and in fact what did happen to my brain
rev2-NL0uxDscjdo-00005 i understand how this could happen
rev2-NYKcOFQCeno-00001 and that might have been the case
rev2-NYKcOFQCeno-00003 and that leads to a very powerful tool
rev2-NoCOagL69Ss-00001 to me it's not that clear
rev2-NoCOagL69Ss-00002 that may not always be the case
rev2-NqOjj1FCcVY-00001 imagine if we had across the country right now in local places but
rev2-NqOjj1FCcVY-00003 let me tell you about a couple of them
rev2-NqOjj1FCcVY-00004 it's just a wall
rev2-NqOjj1FCcVY-00005 i have passion in my heart
rev2-NqOjj1FCcVY-00006 i can stand up and do something
rev2-NqOjj1FCcVY-00007 both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
rev2-O0JDDyqtSVY-00001 but you know what
rev2-O0JDDyqtSVY-00002 but you know what
rev2-O3a9AYu5SUQ-00001 and that's pretty amazing
rev2-O6Vayv9FCLM-00001 that option is actually not on the table
rev2-O6Vayv9FCLM-00002 so it's up to us
rev2-ODLgS00f9BE-00002 we could only think of one way
rev2-OIlSXRCSBSI-00001 i even read many self help books
rev2-OIlSXRCSBSI-00002 the first lesson is about humility
rev2-OIlSXRCSBSI-00006 try it and let me know how it works for you
rev2-OIlSXRCSBSI-00007 i would love to hear from you
rev2-OM6XIICmSqo-00001 who's at the event
rev2-OM6XIICmSqo-00002 whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that
rev2-OM6XIICmSqo-00005 i can use it in my company
rev2-ONM4JupBzSE-00001 it's right there for you to find
rev2-ONM4JupBzSE-00003 there's nothing underground about it
rev2-ONM4JupBzSE-00005 we only sell you airtime
rev2-ORthzIOEf30-00001 it was appalling
rev2-OYfoGTIG7pY-00001 pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you
rev2-OYfoGTIG7pY-00002 i remember what you said to me
rev2-OYfoGTIG7pY-00003 i am thinking of your love for me
rev2-OYfoGTIG7pY-00004 i am torn by your love for me
rev2-OYfoGTIG7pY-00007 remember what i said my love
rev2-OYfoGTIG7pY-00010 and i said i don't know
rev2-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00002 when you really look at it how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies
rev2-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00003 you learn more about how computers work
rev2-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00004 he wanted to keep score
rev2-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00005 but it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write
rev2-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00003 you board the plane
rev2-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00004 the plane takes off
rev2-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00005 the engine fails
rev2-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00008 no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
rev2-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00009 they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios
rev2-OzA6jRYjVQs-00001 it's about people
rev2-OzA6jRYjVQs-00003 this is not a statement on malnutrition or anything else
rev2-OzA6jRYjVQs-00004 the net outcome
rev2-OzA6jRYjVQs-00006 china is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has available for agriculture and it has massive
rev2-OzA6jRYjVQs-00008 that even small scale farmers can leverage
rev2-OzA6jRYjVQs-00009 we just need to act on it
rev2-P2AUat93a8Q-00002 would you like to create a second one together
rev2-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00001 we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
rev2-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00004 he wouldn't like the answer
rev2-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00005 or any national leader
rev2-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00006 the supreme court has fallen way down from what it used to be
rev2-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00007 they were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites
rev2-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00009 they are doing it together
rev2-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00011 that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or
rev2-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00012 we can create a global parliament of mayors
rev2-PYHd7rpOTe8-00001 but you know what the actual facts are
rev2-PYHd7rpOTe8-00002 but now it's turned around
rev2-PYHd7rpOTe8-00003 then they had to bring them in
rev2-PaxNc5Sqn6s-00001 make it about the other party
rev2-PbgB2TaYhio-00001 well i think about this all the time
rev2-PbgB2TaYhio-00003 they all look the same under a microscope i mean to a first approximation
rev2-PbgB2TaYhio-00004 but now check out where they go on our tree of life
rev2-PbgB2TaYhio-00007 it's just not possible
rev2-PhVP1tNeGyY-00001 how cool is that
rev2-PrK0CifulU0-00003 now hamilton was everything madison was not
rev2-PrK0CifulU0-00004 and they did it in the good old fashioned way
rev2-PrK0CifulU0-00005 first they founded political parties
rev2-Q6U69HbAF9Y-00002 well we bought one of these
rev2-QKHkSUiQboA-00003 it's kind of the anti reality tv
rev2-QKHkSUiQboA-00004 nobody comes to get famous
rev2-QKHkSUiQboA-00005 and it's hard and it takes courage but that's why we're alive right
rev2-QKHkSUiQboA-00007 how are we going to do that
rev2-QeIrdqU0o9s-00002 i am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye
rev2-QeIrdqU0o9s-00004 how far away was the finish line
rev2-QeIrdqU0o9s-00006 so this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster
rev2-QleRgTBMX88-00001 i think this is a problem
rev2-QleRgTBMX88-00002 beth israel's in boston
rev2-QoT0S2vu9m4-00001 that's a terrible waste of time
rev2-QoT0S2vu9m4-00002 do that only if you're paid by the hour
rev2-QoyBYYpal1Y-00001 so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system
rev2-QuIS7J59SYw-00001 that's my question
rev2-RAR4cz9wkUk-00001 i was not going to cry myself to sleep
rev2-RAR4cz9wkUk-00002 i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
rev2-RCXGpEmFbOw-00001 there are no external cameras
rev2-RD07GkmM2fc-00001 in fact it's more like five percent
rev2-RD07GkmM2fc-00004 and we finally figured out how to do it
rev2-RDIy58g9n2k-00002 it's just incredible
rev2-RDSSLJG7oi8-00001 i'm not strong enough to lift my carry on bag from the ground to the carousel
rev2-RE4ce4mexrU-00002 it's not one way
rev2-RE4ce4mexrU-00004 and i thought what am i thinking
rev2-RE4ce4mexrU-00005 he's five years old
rev2-ROgFmb3oTLo-00001 they have different interests
rev2-ROgFmb3oTLo-00002 they have divergent values
rev2-ROgFmb3oTLo-00004 it means for youth and it's a new arab tv channel
rev2-ROgFmb3oTLo-00005 but it's not about fire and brimstone either
rev2-ROgFmb3oTLo-00007 there is an animated series in the works
rev2-ROgFmb3oTLo-00010 and she's looking as young as ever
rev2-RaSlxoAUP5c-00001 i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one
rev2-RaSlxoAUP5c-00003 which means take my camera
rev2-RaSlxoAUP5c-00004 and he thinks i'm saying take my picture
rev2-RiM5aSvaNkg-00001 i went to extreme lengths to try to be straight
rev2-RiM5aSvaNkg-00002 and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this
rev2-RiM5aSvaNkg-00003 but if you won't move we'll have no choice but to run you down
rev2-RlQ3CSVanaU-00001 i don't understand
rev2-RplnSVTzvnU-00001 we can see everything on wikipedia
rev2-RplnSVTzvnU-00002 it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated
rev2-RplnSVTzvnU-00003 we can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly
rev2-Rw9s0ivfn3w-00001 because we can
rev2-S2Dj9M71JAc-00003 so when we met chuck was a senior in high school
rev2-S2Dj9M71JAc-00006 not a single one
rev2-S2Dj9M71JAc-00007 the question for us now is how much can we make of it
rev2-S2Dj9M71JAc-00008 how much can we change
rev2-S6ufvYWTqQ0-00001 he was also the first person to call me a feminist
rev2-S6ufvYWTqQ0-00005 my brothers are not as interested as i am
rev2-S7t6Ry4PlTo-00001 it's been thought about for a while
rev2-SE97Kgi0sR4-00001 think about that
rev2-SE97Kgi0sR4-00002 they also monitored the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
rev2-SE97Kgi0sR4-00003 terrorists are doing this
rev2-SE97Kgi0sR4-00004 when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob
rev2-SE97Kgi0sR4-00005 of course we're going to go even deeper than the human body
rev2-SE97Kgi0sR4-00006 we're going down to the cellular level these days
rev2-SFnMTHhKdkw-00003 we can do this
rev2-SFnMTHhKdkw-00004 i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the worst
rev2-SFnMTHhKdkw-00005 i'm so sorry
rev2-SFnMTHhKdkw-00008 one year i came up with a bright idea
rev2-SFnMTHhKdkw-00009 we know why kids don't learn
rev2-SFnMTHhKdkw-00010 you made it work for me
rev2-SN7wO06Yz1E-00002 and they put on an opera all night long
rev2-SN7wO06Yz1E-00003 what is the abstraction
rev2-SN7wO06Yz1E-00004 it's so obvious
rev2-SN7wO06Yz1E-00005 you don't question that
rev2-SN7wO06Yz1E-00006 that's what moves you
rev2-SN7wO06Yz1E-00008 i'm in the crucible right now
rev2-SN7wO06Yz1E-00009 i know you understand that
rev2-SS8TSf2srSw-00002 seventy five percent of them are women and children
rev2-SS8TSf2srSw-00003 that was her fight
rev2-SS8TSf2srSw-00006 she got a support network
rev2-SS8TSf2srSw-00007 she learned about her rights
rev2-SS8TSf2srSw-00008 she was doing okay
rev2-SSzRfSJTNW4-00001 what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary
rev2-SSzRfSJTNW4-00003 why do we need to study this anymore
rev2-SSzRfSJTNW4-00005 don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization
rev2-SSzRfSJTNW4-00006 indeed we run the risk of making things worse
rev2-SSzRfSJTNW4-00007 imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics
rev2-SWiwSBLXS3k-00001 and not just that
rev2-SWiwSBLXS3k-00002 they met together
rev2-SWiwSBLXS3k-00003 why is it important now
rev2-SWiwSBLXS3k-00008 so what did they do
rev2-SWvJxasiSZ8-00004 but people did not relate to this
rev2-SWvJxasiSZ8-00005 i don't know
rev2-SWvJxasiSZ8-00006 people started contributing ideas
rev2-SWvJxasiSZ8-00009 and that's actually what happened
rev2-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00001 you see there's a lot of things we just don't have data on
rev2-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00002 it's a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world
rev2-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00003 but we're not there yet
rev2-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00004 with that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen
rev2-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00008 data drives better decisions
rev2-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00010 it's a win all around
rev2-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00012 and that's a big deal for a profession that's in high demand
rev2-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00013 there's going to be a new system based on donated package tracking technology from the logistics company that i work for
rev2-SaouBn7IKIo-00001 we've been working together since well since we were kids really
rev2-SaouBn7IKIo-00002 which brought us to this
rev2-Sbm98rrVZzE-00001 but i need your help
rev2-Sddb0Khx0yA-00001 so what to do next
rev2-Sew0bn8mGAA-00002 the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place
rev2-Sew0bn8mGAA-00004 what do they have
rev2-Sew0bn8mGAA-00006 do they have aids
rev2-Sew0bn8mGAA-00007 do they have a common cold
rev2-Sew0bn8mGAA-00009 you make it flow under and over
rev2-Sktdq5z1NS4-00001 and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more
rev2-SmLeSPk3ddE-00001 take a look at these
rev2-SnSHsb5xKPo-00001 it took six days to deploy a global malware campaign
rev2-SnSHsb5xKPo-00002 it should be inspiring
rev2-SpTGUTSFvf4-00001 some did not everybody
rev2-SpTGUTSFvf4-00003 even that wasn't enough
rev2-SpTGUTSFvf4-00004 she wanted to change policy at the government level
rev2-SsqlpgMKjyU-00001 i actually have no idea why
rev2-SsqlpgMKjyU-00002 i didn't talk to them
rev2-SsqlpgMKjyU-00003 go pick up the keys
rev2-Sv5QitqbxJw-00003 they're too busy putting out daily fires to think ahead strategically
rev2-Sv5QitqbxJw-00004 and they don't need to ask for permission
rev2-TDaFwnOiKVE-00002 and i said that's a good job
rev2-TDaFwnOiKVE-00003 this isn't information
rev2-TDaFwnOiKVE-00004 it's super real and it's happening around you
rev2-TGZMSmcuiXM-00001 that's what's so complicated about war
rev2-TGZMSmcuiXM-00002 it was incredibly hot
rev2-TGZMSmcuiXM-00003 how does that work
rev2-TGZMSmcuiXM-00004 it's not what i had expected
rev2-TGZMSmcuiXM-00008 what is it that he misses
rev2-TGZMSmcuiXM-00009 we have to answer that
rev2-TGZMSmcuiXM-00012 the boys are up there for a year
rev2-TGZMSmcuiXM-00013 some of them got out of the army and had tremendous psychological problems when they got home
rev2-TRajLqEaWhQ-00002 that means at some point it's going to be your problem too
rev2-TScetimMBL8-00002 i realize of course that all countries are unique
rev2-TScetimMBL8-00003 that's nothing special
rev2-TScetimMBL8-00004 it had no choice
rev2-TScetimMBL8-00005 again it had no choice
rev2-TScetimMBL8-00006 just when that's the last thing you want to do
rev2-TUgBdSyK7S4-00001 i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
rev2-TUxwiVFgghE-00001 how much they do
rev2-TVtgb153S6I-00001 and we connected over really small things like the fact that i love country music which is really
rev2-TVtgb153S6I-00002 this is not a photo profile for your facebook
rev2-U6FvJ6jMGHU-00002 that didn't go over really well
rev2-U6FvJ6jMGHU-00003 so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free
rev2-U6PoUg7jXsA-00001 the answer was no
rev2-U6PoUg7jXsA-00002 do you remember what it was
rev2-U6PoUg7jXsA-00004 and i got pretty into it
rev2-U6PoUg7jXsA-00005 this is how stuff is made memorable
rev2-UAinLaT42xY-00001 what makes technology useful and usable
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00001 i will craft my own drum
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00003 i will not be played
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00006 we mourn women complicated
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00011 i live cycles of light and darkness
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00012 rhythm is half silence
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00013 i see now i never was one and not the other
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00014 sickness health tender violence
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00016 one woman loses her head
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00017 one woman feeds on trash
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00018 one woman shoots her face
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00019 one woman straps herself
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00020 one woman gives birth to a baby
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00021 one woman gives birth to borders
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00022 one woman no longer believes love will ever find her
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00023 one woman never did
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00024 where do refugee hearts go
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00025 faced with absence
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00027 my spine curves spiral
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00028 cluster bombs left behind
rev2-UAj1hsXp18c-00030 harvest contaminated tobacco
rev2-UAq4yBdSYZs-00001 so after 25 years i began to feel as though i was running dry
rev2-UAq4yBdSYZs-00002 they will sit in them forever
rev2-UK8ccWSZkic-00001 of those seven have nuclear weapons
rev2-ULNPLFrTirQ-00001 i'm pushing and pulling with this object
rev2-UMhLBPPtlrY-00002 she got unlucky
rev2-UMhLBPPtlrY-00004 what if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all
rev2-UMhLBPPtlrY-00005 that wasn't being asked
rev2-UZmXwOgNq7c-00001 only one percent of the people are actually farmers
rev2-UZmXwOgNq7c-00002 so what can we do
rev2-UZmXwOgNq7c-00005 talk to farmers
rev2-UmvOgW6iV2s-00001 casual speech is something quite different
rev2-UmvOgW6iV2s-00002 that's what texting is
rev2-UmvOgW6iV2s-00003 it's a marker of empathy
rev2-UmvOgW6iV2s-00004 any spoken language that's used by real people has them
rev2-UmvOgW6iV2s-00007 texting has developed one from this slash
rev2-Us70DN2XSfM-00001 like why did i really have to mow the lawn
rev2-Us70DN2XSfM-00002 you can't run around in the dark
rev2-Us70DN2XSfM-00003 you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
rev2-Us70DN2XSfM-00005 and it's not that they didn't want me to think critically
rev2-UtBsl3j0YRQ-00002 you haven't earned it
rev2-UtBsl3j0YRQ-00004 we have to get quiet
rev2-UtBsl3j0YRQ-00006 how can we do it
rev2-V1yW5IsnSjo-00001 i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trap disguised as love one
rev2-V1yW5IsnSjo-00003 which is why that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future
rev2-V1yW5IsnSjo-00004 and here's where those guns come in
rev2-V1yW5IsnSjo-00005 he kept one in the glove compartment of our car
rev2-V1yW5IsnSjo-00006 i had just graduated from harvard college
rev2-V1yW5IsnSjo-00008 the question why does she stay
rev2-V1yW5IsnSjo-00009 show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your coworkers your friends and
rev2-V4sSabKqyMU-00001 but there's so much potential
rev2-V4sSabKqyMU-00002 and i went back home and i said daddy i don't know who i am
rev2-V4sSabKqyMU-00003 so since then i've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
rev2-V4sSabKqyMU-00004 brought in younger men
rev2-V4sSabKqyMU-00005 it's about proving who you are and what you can do
rev2-V4sSabKqyMU-00006 and this is true
rev2-VAJS5J21Rd0-00001 are they attractive
rev2-VAJS5J21Rd0-00003 are they a potential mate
rev2-VAJS5J21Rd0-00004 when you're six maybe you can do that
rev2-VAJS5J21Rd0-00005 i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
rev2-VAJS5J21Rd0-00008 how old are you
rev2-VAJS5J21Rd0-00009 so i changed my immediate goal to 10000 faces
rev2-VIgzTLDyObo-00001 so momentum is good
rev2-VIgzTLDyObo-00002 often what happens is you're planning so hard for like how do i get through the hardest part
rev2-VIgzTLDyObo-00003 how do i get through the hardest part
rev2-VIgzTLDyObo-00004 and then what happens
rev2-VSLurJfOSiA-00001 and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things
rev2-VSLurJfOSiA-00002 you were born to
rev2-VSLurJfOSiA-00005 that's what we do
rev2-VfAiNX7jn9A-00001 young people as well
rev2-VfAiNX7jn9A-00004 and that's what we did
rev2-VfAiNX7jn9A-00006 we hear the chaos of war
rev2-VfAiNX7jn9A-00007 we hear terrorism
rev2-VfAiNX7jn9A-00010 the silent majority does not need to be silent
rev2-VfAiNX7jn9A-00011 let's help them have a voice
rev2-VfAiNX7jn9A-00012 thank you very much
rev2-VsjTVGIw4z8-00003 and we all know this
rev2-VsjTVGIw4z8-00005 okay then we can make a mobile geiger counter
rev2-VsjTVGIw4z8-00006 we can drive around
rev2-VsjTVGIw4z8-00007 we can get volunteers
rev2-VsjTVGIw4z8-00008 we don't have enough money
rev2-VxESitIllxE-00001 and then we were alarmed to discover something
rev2-VxESitIllxE-00002 no plankton means no fish
rev2-VxESitIllxE-00004 as an inventor i try and turn fantasy into reality
rev2-VxESitIllxE-00007 not when you get lung cancer
rev2-VzyjDRSAWzE-00001 it's an unconscious process
rev2-VzyjDRSAWzE-00002 it's an automatic process
rev2-WFCvkkDSfIU-00002 one way around this is to draw pictures
rev2-WFCvkkDSfIU-00003 and this idea is actually nothing new
rev2-WT7VMrxTPPA-00001 there's no other way
rev2-WT7VMrxTPPA-00003 i mean i thought poetry was just self expression
rev2-WT7VMrxTPPA-00004 i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
rev2-WTFi99e4RXU-00001 only we don't know that it's a homeless shelter
rev2-XBJQENjZJaA-00001 5 percent today
rev2-XBJQENjZJaA-00002 how is that possible
rev2-XBJQENjZJaA-00003 that's different from actually having an effective ad campaign
rev2-XESFPEFpHt4-00001 where would it go
rev2-XESFPEFpHt4-00002 you can walk around them
rev2-XESFPEFpHt4-00003 was the internet actually a place that you could visit
rev2-XESFPEFpHt4-00004 could i go there
rev2-XESFPEFpHt4-00005 who would i meet
rev2-XESFPEFpHt4-00007 the whole internet
rev2-XESFPEFpHt4-00008 is it heavy
rev2-XESFPEFpHt4-00010 i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for
rev2-XESFPEFpHt4-00011 you can experience their sense of place
rev2-XESFPEFpHt4-00013 we let other people worry about it
rev2-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00001 so i learned never to move
rev2-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00005 it would skip a beat
rev2-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00006 it would start
rev2-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00007 it would stop
rev2-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00008 and i felt all this
rev2-XNbaR54Gpj4-00001 does any of this matter
rev2-XYNUpQrZISc-00001 why is that hard
rev2-XYNUpQrZISc-00002 that will change everything when we see that
rev2-YD5PFdghryc-00001 and so many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where i would walk across borders
rev2-YyXRYgjQXX0-00001 the answer to that question is a very definitive
rev2-YyXRYgjQXX0-00002 and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers that i would never sell them one of our crappy products
rev2-YyXRYgjQXX0-00007 it's all about what can you do for me
rev2-YyXRYgjQXX0-00008 agreeable people are warm and friendly they're nice they're polite
rev2-YyXRYgjQXX0-00010 whereas giving and taking are more of your inner motives what are your values
rev2-YyXRYgjQXX0-00011 what are your intentions toward others
rev2-YyXRYgjQXX0-00013 they'll say i'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks
rev2-YzGjO5aHShQ-00002 and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the
rev2-YzGjO5aHShQ-00004 i was talking about interaction design
rev2-YzGjO5aHShQ-00005 and does it matter
rev2-YzGjO5aHShQ-00006 you know it's like once again there's this whole problem of design being often misunderstood for art
rev2-YzGjO5aHShQ-00007 designers aspire to be really great designers
rev2-YzGjO5aHShQ-00012 what we want what we aspire to is the code
rev2-YzGjO5aHShQ-00013 it's very hard to get of course
rev2-YzGjO5aHShQ-00016 we're going to stay with them forever
rev2-YzGjO5aHShQ-00017 i mean that interface is beautiful
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00001 it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in trenton
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00002 now at that time camden new jersey was the most dangerous city in america
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00003 i ran the camden police department because of that
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00004 and they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00005 and one of them said we had a robbery two weeks ago
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00007 we have no suspects
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00008 we have no suspects
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00012 it worked for the oakland a's and it worked in the state of new jersey
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00013 we took camden off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in america
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00016 and all of this matters greatly because public safety to me is the most important function of
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00019 they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00020 they're just waiting for their day in court
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00021 and 67 percent of people come back
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00023 so when i started my job at the arnold foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00024 and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i feel the exact same way that i did about the state of
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00025 so i decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make the most critical decision
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00026 it impacts everything
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00027 it impacts sentencing
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00029 it impacts crime and violence
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00030 and when i talk to judges around the united states which i do all the time now they all say the same
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00031 but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00033 and i couldn't get this information out
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00035 and at the other end of the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00037 they're like the baseball scouts 20 years ago
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00044 some people call it data science
rev2-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00047 they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
rev2-Zd71719SG8Y-00001 thank you very much
rev2-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00001 but things have changed
rev2-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00004 but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
rev2-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00006 and that's exactly what that is
rev2-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00007 we do train them however to adjust caution according to where they are
rev2-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00008 out to dinner with family
rev2-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00009 you remember carlos
rev2-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00010 he wanted to sit where he could scan the room where he could plan escape routes where he could get his hands
rev2-Zo62S0ulqhA-00001 how do you change your behavior
rev2-Zo62S0ulqhA-00003 he could come over and help me
rev2-aSavBsX60Ss-00001 and it doesn't
rev2-aSavBsX60Ss-00003 so naturally i asked what is african
rev2-akiQuyhXR8o-00001 i don't look different
rev2-akiQuyhXR8o-00002 i'm not short
rev2-akiQuyhXR8o-00003 again let's just play
rev2-akiQuyhXR8o-00004 i needed an education
rev2-akiQuyhXR8o-00005 now i'm ready for my interview
rev2-akiQuyhXR8o-00006 i was right there with you
rev2-akiQuyhXR8o-00007 did i get my upgrade
rev2-akiQuyhXR8o-00010 we must adopt that way of giving back
rev2-akiQuyhXR8o-00011 that doesn't probably happen every day
rev2-aoGJP02CtPA-00002 if any child is found violating these rules he is severely reprimanded
rev2-aoGJP02CtPA-00003 effectively the taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information
rev2-aoGJP02CtPA-00004 their parents are so poor they have no resources to get them back
rev2-aupPrDnhrKA-00001 thank you for your time
rev2-aupPrDnhrKA-00002 i'll let you continue
rev2-b6YTQJVzwlI-00001 so what happens next
rev2-bArH8r8jJ4g-00001 it turns out the evidence says otherwise
rev2-bArH8r8jJ4g-00002 none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people
rev2-bArH8r8jJ4g-00004 it's a pretty simple idea right
rev2-bS6SiVz1R0o-00001 it is the default option
rev2-bS6SiVz1R0o-00002 you just move away
rev2-bS6SiVz1R0o-00003 you're more cautious
rev2-bS6SiVz1R0o-00004 and you walk around and it points to things
rev2-c0KYU2j0TM4-00001 that is great
rev2-c0KYU2j0TM4-00002 thank you very much
rev2-c64M1tZyWPM-00001 so why is it
rev2-c64M1tZyWPM-00002 why aren't people washing their hands
rev2-c64M1tZyWPM-00003 did you learn to wash your hands at home
rev2-c64M1tZyWPM-00004 did you learn to wash your hands in school
rev2-c9V6OKlY80k-00001 but i love it for a totally different reason
rev2-c9V6OKlY80k-00002 they make sense of the past
rev2-cHRZ6OrSvvI-00001 three billion people today with cell phones can't access the internet
rev2-cHRZ6OrSvvI-00002 don't create solutions to impress customers
rev2-cmpu58yv8Sg-00001 we harbor bias
rev2-cmpu58yv8Sg-00002 we know that we are right and they are wrong
rev2-cmpu58yv8Sg-00004 well that's what i thought
rev2-cmpu58yv8Sg-00005 if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video for example your answer
rev2-cmpu58yv8Sg-00007 harness your internal strength
rev2-d3syTrElgcg-00001 look at the end to see the animal
rev2-d6NKdnZvdoo-00002 just think about it
rev2-d6NKdnZvdoo-00003 but it's a global phenomenon
rev2-dS8n24ZwZcQ-00001 one billion people
rev2-dS8n24ZwZcQ-00002 but the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate
rev2-dYNc3P4jSt4-00001 so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
rev2-dYNc3P4jSt4-00004 she never had to duck and cover under her desk at school
rev2-dYNc3P4jSt4-00006 but before that cooperation could be realized kennedy was assassinated and that part of the
rev2-dYNc3P4jSt4-00007 but it's also an important date for another reason
rev2-dYNc3P4jSt4-00008 have inspired a generation of innovators
rev2-ddxHlkIuHqg-00001 i'm a doctor
rev2-ddxHlkIuHqg-00002 but too often my treatments made them feel worse
rev2-ddxHlkIuHqg-00004 we can do that because we know
rev2-eNAHVnkll5M-00001 who cleans up after us
rev2-eNAHVnkll5M-00002 i wanted to get to know them as individuals
rev2-eNAHVnkll5M-00003 i wanted to understand who takes the job
rev2-eNAHVnkll5M-00004 so i started a research project with them
rev2-eNAHVnkll5M-00005 it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
rev2-eNAHVnkll5M-00008 the economy needs them
rev2-eNAHVnkll5M-00011 take a moment to say thank you
rev2-eVFYhbHpfqU-00001 please sign here right now
rev2-eVFYhbHpfqU-00002 why does a jellyfish emit light
rev2-eVFYhbHpfqU-00003 or a firefly
rev2-eVFYhbHpfqU-00007 and that's powerful
rev2-eVFYhbHpfqU-00008 no not how much
rev2-eVFYhbHpfqU-00009 it's more annoying
rev2-eVFYhbHpfqU-00011 it goes wrong
rev2-eZj5n8ScTkI-00001 i couldn't tear myself away from the coverage
rev2-eZj5n8ScTkI-00002 and others resented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights and
rev2-eZj5n8ScTkI-00003 and this wasn't just an abstract question
rev2-eZj5n8ScTkI-00005 african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded
rev2-emW1TQ290ec-00001 can we really scale this up
rev2-eqsXcSaefKI-00001 everything in the universe wears out
rev2-eqsXcSaefKI-00002 and that blew my mind
rev2-esD6aaIjhek-00001 they don't have meaning
rev2-fC9da6eqaqg-00001 you're doing incredibly important work
rev2-fIICVeGW4RY-00001 you are a healer in a stone age village
rev2-fIICVeGW4RY-00003 but eventually they did come around
rev2-fIICVeGW4RY-00004 and so it's perfect for something like that
rev2-fIICVeGW4RY-00006 we need to see beyond the surface
rev2-fTSXvLzNd0o-00002 there won't be a single moment in the schedule
rev2-fZ8eyWBQmfU-00001 now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic
rev2-fscaRh2OtXk-00002 i am sick to my stomach
rev2-fscaRh2OtXk-00003 how do you know for sure
rev2-fscaRh2OtXk-00004 we created a diagnostic test
rev2-fxbCHn6gE3U-00001 i'm the opposite
rev2-fxbCHn6gE3U-00003 then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are
rev2-fxbCHn6gE3U-00005 so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get better at my job i just need to upgrade my browser
rev2-fxbCHn6gE3U-00007 they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all
rev2-fxbCHn6gE3U-00008 they have bad ideas
rev2-gSycQufrgK4-00001 that's next to impossible
rev2-gSycQufrgK4-00002 so i went in that direction
rev2-gVfgkFaswn4-00001 this is a crisis that's getting worse day by day
rev2-gVfgkFaswn4-00002 so the answer to the second question can we change
rev2-gVfgkFaswn4-00003 we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
rev2-gVfgkFaswn4-00006 but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is
rev2-gtpTd3ywwiE-00001 but that's kind of a big problem
rev2-hQigUH0vZSE-00001 and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
rev2-hiIcwt88o94-00001 i just disagree with this
rev2-hiIcwt88o94-00002 like we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share
rev2-hiIcwt88o94-00003 and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity man or woman
rev2-hiIcwt88o94-00005 i want to go
rev2-hiIcwt88o94-00006 and i was like oh the amazon
rev2-hiIcwt88o94-00008 they grow crops
rev2-hiIcwt88o94-00010 there's people everywhere
rev2-hiIcwt88o94-00017 and this is crazy
rev2-hiIcwt88o94-00018 and i'm sure the figures are similar in other countries
rev2-hiIcwt88o94-00019 every kid lives near nature
rev2-hiIcwt88o94-00020 we've just somehow forgotten how to see it
rev2-hiIcwt88o94-00023 there's pollination going on
rev2-hxsnKwmW0dk-00002 we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
rev2-hxsnKwmW0dk-00003 i have an idea for saving the world
rev2-iPE2SiCCo0w-00001 most of my friends were taking japanese
rev2-iPE2SiCCo0w-00002 so i thought why not punish myself
rev2-iPE2SiCCo0w-00004 i was always very small
rev2-iPE2SiCCo0w-00007 so water was something that scared me to begin with
rev2-iPE2SiCCo0w-00008 but i would go in on occasion
rev2-iPE2SiCCo0w-00009 and i thought this would be great fun
rev2-iPE2SiCCo0w-00013 and this routine went on for some time
rev2-iPE2SiCCo0w-00015 i tried everything
rev2-iPE2SiCCo0w-00018 and this became my holy grail my rosetta stone
rev2-iPE2SiCCo0w-00021 and now i love languages
rev2-iPE2SiCCo0w-00023 i know nothing
rev2-iqEHuBST2qQ-00001 and then i thought there's got to be a better way
rev2-j7fRIGphgtk-00001 well i didn't have any idea
rev2-j7fRIGphgtk-00002 our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
rev2-j7fRIGphgtk-00004 i had to have faith
rev2-j7fRIGphgtk-00005 it would be a mall and not a park
rev2-jPf0LjZAS14-00001 is it about earning as much as you possibly can
rev2-jPf0LjZAS14-00003 how should we work
rev2-jPf0LjZAS14-00004 how should we live
rev2-jPf0LjZAS14-00008 we need portable health benefits
rev2-jPf0LjZAS14-00009 i would never want to do that
rev2-jPf0LjZAS14-00010 we need to reinvent labor organizing
rev2-jbHpF7EySck-00001 they want to be part of it
rev2-jbHpF7EySck-00002 and they say i want to work in global poverty but what will it mean about my career
rev2-jcSSY9rDN2g-00001 there's a flip side as well
rev2-jcSSY9rDN2g-00002 it's shocking to realize that only 28 percent of american
rev2-jcp5vvxtEaU-00001 how do you get informed
rev2-jcp5vvxtEaU-00002 we paid two to three times more than anybody else
rev2-jcp5vvxtEaU-00004 there's no more of it
rev2-jcp5vvxtEaU-00006 let's go back and visit our equation
rev2-jcp5vvxtEaU-00008 we're not going to be able to do that
rev2-jcp5vvxtEaU-00009 even if we get everybody working on it we've got to be strategic
rev2-jcp5vvxtEaU-00010 so we did the analysis again a slightly different way
rev2-jcp5vvxtEaU-00011 so it's the demand that brings them to the table
rev2-jcp5vvxtEaU-00012 sustainability has got to be a pre competitive issue
rev2-jggHw5PdQV0-00001 and my whole world did open up
rev2-jggHw5PdQV0-00002 and who does that benefit
rev2-jggHw5PdQV0-00003 we now have a platform
rev2-jiUKpX09zo4-00001 it really is quite phenomenal
rev2-jtVIDBs60S8-00001 that was powerful
rev2-jtVIDBs60S8-00004 it's actually not that hard
rev2-jtVIDBs60S8-00005 raise your hands
rev2-k2hQL9Zrokk-00001 take my child
rev2-k2hQL9Zrokk-00002 i believe a story there has to be told
rev2-k2hQL9Zrokk-00003 they don't get their money out
rev2-k2hQL9Zrokk-00005 she worked in a bank
rev2-k2hQL9Zrokk-00006 i have to report it
rev2-k2hQL9Zrokk-00008 who cares about bosnia
rev2-kEKzl6fub2w-00001 which incidentally is only a third correct
rev2-kEKzl6fub2w-00002 i don't mean giving up the internet
rev2-kEKzl6fub2w-00003 this is your chance
rev2-ka8L1YMR88U-00001 that didn't happen to me
rev2-ka8L1YMR88U-00004 make it go away
rev2-ka8L1YMR88U-00005 make it go away
rev2-ka8L1YMR88U-00006 make it go away
rev2-ka8L1YMR88U-00008 we can't identify with that part
rev2-kcEIsbO0ivA-00001 you might get impeached for that
rev2-kwYxHPXIaao-00001 well not yet
rev2-l5vZHuAtDZA-00001 well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
rev2-l5vZHuAtDZA-00003 so was mother teresa
rev2-lmyZMtPVodo-00001 that is some deep deep emotion when you would want to do that
rev2-lmyZMtPVodo-00002 we have no control over these forces
rev2-lrSmXnUoUXM-00002 well guess what
rev2-lrSmXnUoUXM-00003 now i know why i'm here
rev2-m6X1i8khmt8-00001 and i was really scared
rev2-m6X1i8khmt8-00002 the irony is so obvious right
rev2-m6X1i8khmt8-00004 but i found one
rev2-mSHBma0Ithk-00001 they want to get out
rev2-mSHBma0Ithk-00002 allow many people to come in
rev2-mSHBma0Ithk-00003 let us have a hong kong nearby
rev2-mSHBma0Ithk-00006 when we share ideas we all get more
rev2-mc0vhSseGk4-00001 so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really
rev2-mgcjr1yz7ow-00002 is it about systems
rev2-mgcjr1yz7ow-00003 is it about equality
rev2-mgcjr1yz7ow-00005 i started looking at them really carefully
rev2-mgcjr1yz7ow-00006 i looked at my friend who drilled seven dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
rev2-mgcjr1yz7ow-00008 these guys could be true to their purpose which was finding oil and gas
rev2-mgcjr1yz7ow-00009 and they were basically having fun
rev2-mgcjr1yz7ow-00013 we need to be part of a community to survive
rev2-mgcjr1yz7ow-00015 it's very hard to make them part of our rational decision
rev2-mgcjr1yz7ow-00016 we all know deep inside what the answer is
rev2-mgcjr1yz7ow-00017 we've known since we were babies
rev2-mjDjbJJlqZ0-00001 we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place
rev2-mxNpNuogqsY-00003 what are the researchers learning
rev2-mxNpNuogqsY-00004 so i was jealous
rev2-mxNpNuogqsY-00005 i know i didn't
rev2-mxNpNuogqsY-00006 i think i'm a normal person
rev2-n3kNlFMXslo-00002 that's like finding an extra hour in the day
rev2-n3kNlFMXslo-00003 yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found
rev2-n3kNlFMXslo-00005 so how do we do that
rev2-n3kNlFMXslo-00006 but you can write it
rev2-n3kNlFMXslo-00010 you say you're working more than 60 hours
rev2-n3kNlFMXslo-00011 well are you sure
rev2-n3kNlFMXslo-00012 and that's even if you're working way more than full time hours
rev2-n3kNlFMXslo-00013 we don't even need that much time to do amazing things
rev2-nASJ0510Pxs-00002 so they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them
rev2-nASJ0510Pxs-00003 thanks very much
rev2-nCg2NcGYu34-00001 why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
rev2-nCg2NcGYu34-00004 he also had 11 children
rev2-nCg2NcGYu34-00006 not the wife not the kids
rev2-nCg2NcGYu34-00008 i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
rev2-nCg2NcGYu34-00009 please look at me
rev2-nCg2NcGYu34-00011 who is going to inherit his name and his fortune
rev2-nCg2NcGYu34-00012 he should not have been surprised
rev2-nG3vB2CuSjM-00001 not right now
rev2-ni4FV5zL6lM-00001 government officials are extremely mad
rev2-ni4FV5zL6lM-00003 but those surveillance features come at a cost
rev2-npNYP2vzaPo-00001 how can we get so much information out of so little motion
rev2-npNYP2vzaPo-00002 we would just get noise back
rev2-npNYP2vzaPo-00004 we push and pull and poke and prod things
rev2-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00001 how do you find a dinosaur
rev2-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00002 that's the magic of the geological record
rev2-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00003 but we only get one history and it's the one that we have
rev2-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00004 but this particular reality was not inevitable
rev2-oDNgnrtSD8w-00001 come on man
rev2-oYp5XuGYqqY-00002 we were wrong
rev2-oYp5XuGYqqY-00003 now that's a very very good point
rev2-ooAIIeo4AJQ-00001 you smell money
rev2-ooAIIeo4AJQ-00002 we wouldn't tolerate that
rev2-ooAIIeo4AJQ-00003 thank you very much
rev2-os69gEFXUW4-00001 what can i learn with you
rev2-pFDoCLf96Kg-00001 and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance
rev2-pnv5iKB2hl4-00001 i don't care
rev2-psN1DORYYV0-00002 at what point did i think that was a good idea
rev2-psN1DORYYV0-00004 she said yeah
rev2-psN1DORYYV0-00005 why did you bring this up
rev2-psN1DORYYV0-00006 have you lost your mind
rev2-psN1DORYYV0-00008 i'm a fifth generation texan
rev2-psN1DORYYV0-00012 it's the best way to shut people down on an airplane
rev2-psN1DORYYV0-00013 what do you do
rev2-psN1DORYYV0-00014 i study shame
rev2-psN1DORYYV0-00016 i guess i'm doing it right now
rev2-psN1DORYYV0-00017 your wife left you
rev2-psN1DORYYV0-00018 i made a mistake
rev2-psN1DORYYV0-00019 and here's what you need to know
rev2-psN1DORYYV0-00020 he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms
rev2-q2gO4DKVpa8-00001 i am certainly not the hardest working
rev2-q2gO4DKVpa8-00002 i was a mediocre student
rev2-q2gO4DKVpa8-00004 it has never happened
rev2-q2gO4DKVpa8-00005 i was the first non family investor in amazon
rev2-q2gO4DKVpa8-00006 this is nonsense
rev2-qWNae7vYK6s-00001 thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame
rev2-qWNae7vYK6s-00002 and when she went to complain to a major he said what
rev2-qWNae7vYK6s-00003 again in a car
rev2-qWNae7vYK6s-00004 i was petrified
rev2-qWNae7vYK6s-00006 sexual harassment doesn't discriminate
rev2-qWNae7vYK6s-00007 not a lot of hands
rev2-qWNae7vYK6s-00008 you don't get the same witnesses or depositions
rev2-qWNae7vYK6s-00009 they just do it
rev2-qYUmI5kGsYk-00001 so we need the solutions and these people playing the game they are trying out
rev2-qafSjNLjedo-00001 and we've all heard that kind of story before right
rev2-qlty0OPcU6k-00001 now do something different
rev2-qlty0OPcU6k-00002 that would not work
rev2-qsJYrwzfd6w-00004 and after that initial prototype we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have
rev2-qsJYrwzfd6w-00005 and then guess what
rev2-qsJYrwzfd6w-00006 could we leverage the cloud
rev2-qsJYrwzfd6w-00007 so why don't we leverage that
rev2-rBKV4rOgSJU-00008 and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
rev2-rFpDK2KhAgw-00001 they have social meaning
rev2-rFpDK2KhAgw-00002 they were unexpected pleasures
rev2-rFpDK2KhAgw-00003 sometimes it goes further
rev2-rFpDK2KhAgw-00006 or where does he live
rev2-rFpDK2KhAgw-00007 strangers might ask each other for a sip of water
rev2-rGfhahVBIQw-00001 and this leads to oddities
rev2-rGfhahVBIQw-00002 but this is the source of innovation
rev2-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00001 well why is that
rev2-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00002 now i will maintain
rev2-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00005 what difference does it make if they talk like jerry seinfeld
rev2-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00006 i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
rev2-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00007 well what difference does this make
rev2-rSSanSYZDT4-00001 and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive
rev2-rSSanSYZDT4-00002 what makes the heart unique
rev2-rZCxdbqMc2Q-00001 i will be back
rev2-rftagV38YKY-00001 i didn't know where i was
rev2-s0YjL9rZyR0-00003 this is not a put down of anyone
rev2-s0YjL9rZyR0-00004 it is wrong
rev2-s0YjL9rZyR0-00005 it is irresponsible
rev2-s0YjL9rZyR0-00007 are we brave enough to welcome it
rev2-s0YjL9rZyR0-00008 but it's different
rev2-s4smjT1qwZU-00002 there's no structure
rev2-sVtIuDKFO1c-00001 getting a college education is a 20 year investment
rev2-sVtIuDKFO1c-00003 when you grow up poor you want to be rich
rev2-shG0ezBeeJc-00001 how could i let them down
rev2-shG0ezBeeJc-00002 sometimes it's messy and it's always unpredictable
rev2-stngBN4hp14-00001 about a year after 9 11 researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world
rev2-sxnlvwprfSc-00001 i teach at stanford
rev2-sxnlvwprfSc-00002 i'm a physician practicing with cutting edge technology
rev2-sxnlvwprfSc-00003 we're losing a ritual
rev2-sxnlvwprfSc-00007 this is when i was in texas
rev2-sxnlvwprfSc-00008 they had her scanned inside out
rev2-sxnlvwprfSc-00011 i would listen to the heart
rev2-t2gbcVaZ448-00002 after all i was a bit unconventional
rev2-t2gbcVaZ448-00003 i've struggled to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them
rev2-t2gbcVaZ448-00004 what if i had told her my story years ago
rev2-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00001 so you want to go to that board meeting but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest
rev2-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00002 that robot put on a great show
rev2-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00004 we almost don't feel ourselves
rev2-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00005 so what do we do
rev2-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00006 we connect more and more
rev2-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00007 when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
rev2-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00008 and that's what i'm calling for here now
rev2-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00009 do the same thing at work
rev2-ta2Wvy9FSgA-00001 that's pretty cool
rev2-ta2Wvy9FSgA-00002 we have the plan
rev2-ta2Wvy9FSgA-00003 but if they don't stay in paris the international pressure will be overwhelming
rev2-tbSWdVA4Sbo-00001 we might say then well let's not worry about this
rev2-tgSCwQwYNjc-00001 women's day was coming up
rev2-tiSiSM3pk5M-00002 well let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
rev2-tiSiSM3pk5M-00003 what can i do about it
rev2-tiSiSM3pk5M-00005 it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it
rev2-tiSiSM3pk5M-00009 you've broken your back
rev2-tiSiSM3pk5M-00010 you'll never walk again
rev2-tiSiSM3pk5M-00012 it's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away
rev2-tzJYY2p0QIc-00001 growing up i was always intrigued by how people change
rev2-tzJYY2p0QIc-00003 that's not to say it's impossible
rev2-u4L130DkdOw-00001 and how is that possible
rev2-uJr4wGcLNsA-00001 she never wanted to tell me
rev2-uJr4wGcLNsA-00003 my parents came from germany
rev2-uJr4wGcLNsA-00005 some of them were really afraid of contagion and they wouldn't even walk in front of our
rev2-uJr4wGcLNsA-00007 so what was i going to do
rev2-uJr4wGcLNsA-00009 constance baker motley
rev2-uJr4wGcLNsA-00010 that is the right answer
rev2-uL5XUwfkxZw-00002 and work like a dog
rev2-uL5XUwfkxZw-00003 that's your grandfather
rev2-uL5XUwfkxZw-00004 tell me about that
rev2-uL5XUwfkxZw-00006 and that's all
rev2-uL5XUwfkxZw-00007 they were all white
rev2-uL5XUwfkxZw-00008 so they felt safe to come there
rev2-uL5XUwfkxZw-00011 we didn't understand the program
rev2-uL5XUwfkxZw-00013 i said we work together
rev2-uL5XUwfkxZw-00015 i may never go to your house you may never come to my house
rev2-uqS6T6TAu74-00001 i became a psychology researcher and i've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
rev2-uzKBGtf0i0M-00002 and it is important
rev2-uzKBGtf0i0M-00004 without it we literally can't interface with others
rev2-uzKBGtf0i0M-00005 my history wasn't right
rev2-uzKBGtf0i0M-00007 my desire to disappear was still very powerful
rev2-uzKBGtf0i0M-00008 i take it to therapy
rev2-vGX3FASrQq4-00001 thank you very much
rev2-vXPJVwwEmiM-00001 he's at a technology conference in florida
rev2-vXPJVwwEmiM-00004 you probably won't
rev2-vXPJVwwEmiM-00005 nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
rev2-vXPJVwwEmiM-00006 most independent media was shut down
rev2-vXPJVwwEmiM-00007 we have to fix the internet
rev2-vXPJVwwEmiM-00008 we have to fix our education
rev2-vhVWzkbAW4I-00002 it showed no blockages
rev2-vhVWzkbAW4I-00003 but linda was lucky
rev2-vhVWzkbAW4I-00004 she found us we found her disease
rev2-vhVWzkbAW4I-00005 but for too many women that's not the case
rev2-vhVWzkbAW4I-00007 the authors looked at papers written over a 10 year period and hundreds had to be thrown out
rev2-vhVWzkbAW4I-00008 we know that every cell has a sex
rev2-vhVWzkbAW4I-00011 we have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum
rev2-vhVWzkbAW4I-00012 and it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine
rev2-w1R4F9sSoow-00001 we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just iraq and afghanistan
rev2-w1R4F9sSoow-00003 we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own work
rev2-w1R4F9sSoow-00005 i do believe we can fix what's broken
rev2-w1R4F9sSoow-00006 we all want to
rev2-wG4RnDNWtJo-00001 that was a huge problem at the haiti earthquake
rev2-wG4RnDNWtJo-00003 we lost valuable data
rev2-wG4RnDNWtJo-00004 it's about the data
rev2-wGMLhaa98GI-00001 i can hardly wait
rev2-wKlMcLTqRLs-00001 why did my child develop autism
rev2-wlR1ojoiue0-00001 they were wonderful people
rev2-wlR1ojoiue0-00004 this is possible
rev2-wlR1ojoiue0-00005 the world's companies governments and non profits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this
rev2-wmMrZyVANUo-00001 and in many cases we don't
rev2-wmMrZyVANUo-00002 but we all should
rev2-wmMrZyVANUo-00003 this will pay dividends
rev2-wzkFoetpSSM-00002 i feel that god knows me
rev2-wzkFoetpSSM-00004 and i thought we should just stay home
rev2-wzkFoetpSSM-00005 the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
rev2-wzkFoetpSSM-00007 so we decided to go to the mosque
rev2-x4m6j7rSyzY-00001 i know it works
rev2-x95nwilkaio-00001 but i grew up in canada far from my arab roots
rev2-x95nwilkaio-00002 they have been sold by their families often to wealthy arab tourists
rev2-x95nwilkaio-00003 this is just one face of a booming sex trade across the arab region
rev2-x95nwilkaio-00005 social change doesn't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation
rev2-xFSCX9mAHPo-00001 we're not playing with each other
rev2-xFSCX9mAHPo-00002 there's a million different ways to eat pizza
rev2-xFSCX9mAHPo-00003 if we're still hungry we might have some more
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00004 all of you are members of tribes
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00007 you don't want this
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00008 this is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00009 and i want to make the point that as members of society we need to
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00012 if you want this experience to live on as something historic then at the reception
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00014 but we're not done yet
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00015 it comes out of a place called the gallup organization
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00016 you know they do polls right
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00019 pretty much everybody else who does polls
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00020 so i'd like to leave you with these thoughts
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00021 the group gels
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00023 but you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00024 there was no road map
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00025 in fact south africa has not gone down that road
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00027 life is great
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00031 what about martin luther king
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00034 and he grew up essentially in stage one
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00035 my life really sucks
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00036 i don't know anybody
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00038 but i don't
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00039 you're hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people a tribe about how
rev2-xTkKSJSqUSI-00040 and you don't leave them where they are
rev2-xkFTZcUPjBg-00001 i was going through a hard time as well
rev2-xkFTZcUPjBg-00002 i was like what
rev2-xkFTZcUPjBg-00003 what about you
rev2-xlUPlxSpDRo-00001 you don't have to bring any quarters because the washer and dryer are free
rev2-xukDIWFMU9Y-00002 look at this pretty structure
rev2-xukDIWFMU9Y-00003 has a coherent movement
rev2-y1KIVZw7Jxk-00003 that's not an improbable sample
rev2-y1KIVZw7Jxk-00004 you can navigate space
rev2-y1KIVZw7Jxk-00005 you know about numbers
rev2-y6MC4iXhT6I-00001 we're looking for something more
rev2-yMWlkJAqKYU-00001 how is that possible
rev2-yNhu0MGS2MA-00001 why not just let businesses compete
rev2-yeVz0rtXCmw-00001 i started to walk in the community and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't
rev2-yeVz0rtXCmw-00004 we had law enforcement partners
rev2-yeVz0rtXCmw-00005 they need support
rev2-zL2FOrx41N0-00001 how does it happen
rev2-zMGE3mbS9NY-00001 at the same time
rev2-zuYzOn0U2PY-00001 it's a fucking orgy
rev2-zuYzOn0U2PY-00002 how is it made
rev2-zuYzOn0U2PY-00003 why was it made
rev2-zuYzOn0U2PY-00005 they feel at home
rev3-0Fi83BHQsMA-00002 we really don't walk anymore
rev3-0Fi83BHQsMA-00004 at some point i'm going to get out
rev3-0Fi83BHQsMA-00005 when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
rev3-0Fi83BHQsMA-00006 we'd love to help
rev3-0QVXdEOiCw8-00001 i wasn't very good at reading things
rev3-0VJqrlH9cdI-00001 and he said on the spot absolutely yes
rev3-0VJqrlH9cdI-00002 he was smiling and we said go
rev3-0ZfSOArXbGQ-00001 we said yes
rev3-0ZfSOArXbGQ-00002 we were so excited
rev3-0ZfSOArXbGQ-00003 and so one of the major challenges of our project really is to find photographs that were taken before something
rev3-0gks6ceq4eQ-00002 not what is it
rev3-0gks6ceq4eQ-00005 predictions are the basis of every experience that you have
rev3-0gks6ceq4eQ-00006 they are the basis of every action that you take
rev3-0gks6ceq4eQ-00007 it's using past experience based on similar situations to try to make meaning
rev3-0gks6ceq4eQ-00008 and so how does your brain give you that detail
rev3-0gks6ceq4eQ-00009 well that's what predictions are
rev3-0gks6ceq4eQ-00010 i'm totally serious
rev3-0gks6ceq4eQ-00013 i know i have
rev3-0gks6ceq4eQ-00015 so when you're born you can make feelings like calmness and
rev3-0iIh5YYDR2o-00001 i'm not a social problem guy
rev3-18uDutylDa4-00001 i feel guilty sometimes
rev3-18uDutylDa4-00002 so i'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone
rev3-18uDutylDa4-00004 boy it matters a lot
rev3-18uDutylDa4-00007 what do you mean
rev3-18uDutylDa4-00009 your job needs to be challenging
rev3-18uDutylDa4-00010 he's a great guy
rev3-18uDutylDa4-00011 you want to work for him
rev3-1K5SycZjGhI-00001 blocks have names
rev3-1L6lSFiV4xo-00002 you just have to find another term and look that up
rev3-1L6lSFiV4xo-00003 i do like magic
rev3-1PNX6MSdVsk-00001 i don't have an overview
rev3-1PNX6MSdVsk-00005 more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
rev3-1PNX6MSdVsk-00007 trust is the response
rev3-1PNX6MSdVsk-00009 we can do it two people together trying to improve trust
rev3-1PNX6MSdVsk-00010 because it's given by other people
rev3-1PNX6MSdVsk-00011 let me give you a simple commercial example
rev3-1US4jjWtua8-00001 we're going to eat these cows
rev3-1US4jjWtua8-00002 they're not being shipped up here
rev3-1US4jjWtua8-00004 it's not optional
rev3-1US4jjWtua8-00005 it's not a luxury
rev3-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00001 we've done the research
rev3-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00004 she had to impersonate a man
rev3-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00005 mortality is not going down it's going up
rev3-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00006 and not enough is being done about this
rev3-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00007 it told us about hormone replacement therapy
rev3-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00011 women are worth it
rev3-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00013 so what do you think happens to these gals
rev3-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00014 they're often not recognized sent home
rev3-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00015 i'm not sure what it was
rev3-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00017 well once again women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem
rev3-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00020 and we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years
rev3-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00021 and in fact it probably won't
rev3-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00022 so we have these feast and famine cycles
rev3-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00023 so thank you for your attention
rev3-27lMmdmySb8-00001 everybody focuses on the things that kill us and that's what i was focusing on
rev3-27lMmdmySb8-00002 and they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants
rev3-27lMmdmySb8-00005 actually studied hormones
rev3-27lMmdmySb8-00006 we can't see it most of the time
rev3-27lMmdmySb8-00008 and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases
rev3-2SlBiFZ85d0-00002 i have three sons so i see how they fight
rev3-2SlBiFZ85d0-00003 we're not just part of the same species
rev3-2SlBiFZ85d0-00004 we're part of the same family
rev3-2SlBiFZ85d0-00006 and i won't name names but you know who you are
rev3-2SlBiFZ85d0-00008 so that's what i'm doing
rev3-2UStOghblfE-00001 why are we embedded in social networks
rev3-2UStOghblfE-00002 i mean how do they form
rev3-2UStOghblfE-00003 how do they operate
rev3-2UStOghblfE-00004 how far do they reach
rev3-2UStOghblfE-00005 and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother
rev3-3A1LvXRnpVg-00001 give me input
rev3-3OgsRa7VDtI-00001 they can't get what they need when they need it
rev3-3OgsRa7VDtI-00003 that's the status quo today
rev3-3OgsRa7VDtI-00004 gov just six people
rev3-3OgsRa7VDtI-00008 yes it's hard
rev3-3nSEitPb7BU-00001 but it wasn't just individuals
rev3-3r1IPsldbBg-00002 well there's a self fulfilling prophecy
rev3-3r1IPsldbBg-00003 we shouldn't be nationalistic
rev3-3uSQlcGCHUU-00001 this economy won't work and thomas jefferson saying the people won't trust that
rev3-3uSQlcGCHUU-00006 but that system has tons of problems
rev3-3uSQlcGCHUU-00008 wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive
rev3-3uSQlcGCHUU-00011 but that is not the case at all
rev3-3uSQlcGCHUU-00012 or do you think the government should redistribute
rev3-3uSQlcGCHUU-00014 and nothing happened at all
rev3-3uSQlcGCHUU-00015 so i'm in the media
rev3-3uSQlcGCHUU-00016 they don't represent what our views are
rev3-3uSQlcGCHUU-00017 we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton
rev3-3vfuCPFb8wk-00001 but it's more complicated
rev3-3zqZPujAPuc-00001 so no more missing guys
rev3-48xS00Iy0ac-00002 buildings can be like people
rev3-48xS00Iy0ac-00003 their faces broadcast their experience
rev3-4AYE3w5TWHs-00004 and then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues
rev3-4AYE3w5TWHs-00005 so just like with a bike we don't talk about it
rev3-4AYE3w5TWHs-00006 you can try it
rev3-4ErEBkjS3PY-00001 i'm a professor and we're passionate about education
rev3-4Q2aznfmcYU-00001 now don't get me wrong
rev3-4Q2aznfmcYU-00002 of course they would
rev3-4n8qT0vQbWk-00001 but this is what i heard from a lot of outraged people
rev3-4n8qT0vQbWk-00003 we have to decide what it means
rev3-4v4XxlfVk3o-00001 this is completely bizarre
rev3-55yGmKc6WfE-00001 they're looking and looking and finding love
rev3-5Knz100ldLM-00001 we can open up city hall
rev3-5P04stEjJ9E-00003 i'm not a military brat
rev3-5P04stEjJ9E-00004 they signed up because they wanted some form of revenge
rev3-5P04stEjJ9E-00005 one was to be a soldier
rev3-5P04stEjJ9E-00006 the other was to be a baseball player
rev3-5Yj3nGv0kn8-00001 are you losing your mind
rev3-5Yj3nGv0kn8-00002 so let's watch what happens
rev3-5b5BDoddOLA-00001 so that was easy
rev3-5b5BDoddOLA-00002 we weren't considered the real thing
rev3-5b5BDoddOLA-00004 and the way to do it is through the bloodstream
rev3-5ifMRNag2XU-00001 i want to be the center of attention
rev3-5riPKdpuoiI-00002 did you find the gold
rev3-62cNtvx6P8E-00001 i could make that decision
rev3-66koScWSHBU-00001 and the problem that we're solving is what are those things
rev3-66koScWSHBU-00003 they won the game
rev3-66koScWSHBU-00005 so bear with me
rev3-66koScWSHBU-00006 thank you very much
rev3-6OaIdwUdSxE-00003 make me laugh
rev3-6Waurx8eS1o-00001 how can somebody like that make you feel smart
rev3-6Waurx8eS1o-00003 he made me feel smart
rev3-6Waurx8eS1o-00008 you saw him act
rev3-6kHSuYwt0qs-00002 we don't use audio we don't use video
rev3-6ra1MIKlYB0-00002 how are you
rev3-6wNif5SlN08-00001 the boys reminded me of home
rev3-6wNif5SlN08-00005 i didn't want to
rev3-6wNif5SlN08-00007 i said in arabic
rev3-6wNif5SlN08-00010 after college i desperately needed to find a place to call home
rev3-6wNif5SlN08-00011 1 percent who get to do that
rev3-6wNif5SlN08-00012 they had hit the jackpot
rev3-6wNif5SlN08-00013 life is good
rev3-6wNif5SlN08-00014 it wasn't like them to miss practice
rev3-7OMLSs8t1ng-00001 i do understand it
rev3-7OMLSs8t1ng-00002 doesn't happen very much
rev3-7OMLSs8t1ng-00007 i don't know
rev3-7OMLSs8t1ng-00010 you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases
rev3-7OMLSs8t1ng-00012 what about polio
rev3-7OMLSs8t1ng-00013 let's have that
rev3-7OMLSs8t1ng-00014 no one's ever said that before
rev3-7OMLSs8t1ng-00017 we don't trust the man
rev3-7OMLSs8t1ng-00018 it has to stop
rev3-7OMLSs8t1ng-00019 it's a debate about words about metaphors
rev3-7ZymFMmpOa0-00002 but in fact they found something very surprising
rev3-7ZymFMmpOa0-00005 we used to have a manufacturing economy which was about building goods and products and now we have a service
rev3-7ZymFMmpOa0-00006 but that really isn't true anymore
rev3-7ZymFMmpOa0-00007 you would be issuing orders from above
rev3-7ZymFMmpOa0-00009 this is a real mystery
rev3-7ZymFMmpOa0-00011 and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
rev3-7gXq1ml6B1E-00001 it's natural connective tissue
rev3-7gkdzkVbuVA-00001 originally the sample was aged 18 to 94
rev3-7gkdzkVbuVA-00003 how sad are you right now
rev3-7gkdzkVbuVA-00004 how frustrated are you right now
rev3-7gkdzkVbuVA-00005 we take less notice of trivial matters
rev3-7hQ0rgVfsP8-00001 well i was surprised
rev3-7hQ0rgVfsP8-00002 i did not know this
rev3-7kkRkhAXZGg-00003 now in all seriousness movies are actually really important
rev3-7kkRkhAXZGg-00004 storytelling is so important
rev3-7kkRkhAXZGg-00006 stories are amazing
rev3-7kkRkhAXZGg-00007 but what does
rev3-7kkRkhAXZGg-00010 what would happen
rev3-7nZqiPLCvM4-00001 you don't do much editing
rev3-7qT3RpaBlJo-00001 it is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least
rev3-7qT3RpaBlJo-00002 one you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is
rev3-7uN4I1wEOXE-00001 i have to take a year off
rev3-81Ub0SMxZQo-00001 i'm talking about teachers
rev3-81Ub0SMxZQo-00002 how would i know what i was doing differently
rev3-81Ub0SMxZQo-00003 so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
rev3-87AEeLpodnE-00001 they supported me all the way through it
rev3-87AEeLpodnE-00002 something was wrong
rev3-87AEeLpodnE-00004 has it gotten better
rev3-87AEeLpodnE-00005 that's something we ought to celebrate
rev3-87AEeLpodnE-00008 irreconcilable differences right
rev3-87AEeLpodnE-00010 we're blessed with people who listen to us
rev3-8GQZuzIdeQQ-00001 it wasn't who i was
rev3-8GQZuzIdeQQ-00004 here's where i stand
rev3-8HfoKd873HY-00001 i tried everything
rev3-8K9Gg164Bsw-00001 what a contradiction
rev3-8UhqkX2VAmo-00001 otherwise millions more will die
rev3-8VwTZFYSfvw-00001 i don't even know if it's a real job title to be honest
rev3-8VwTZFYSfvw-00002 it was the coldest i've ever been
rev3-8Z24LCysq3A-00001 one thousand eight hundred and thirty six people died
rev3-8iSpNVj5KMw-00001 he got part time i
rev3-8iSpNVj5KMw-00002 i forgive you and i do not hate you
rev3-8mPpe8AL21A-00001 because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group
rev3-8nbeD1mwCdo-00001 does the water stay there forever
rev3-8nt3edWLgIg-00001 we don't need moore's law to continue
rev3-8nt3edWLgIg-00003 we just need to keep going
rev3-8nt3edWLgIg-00004 we have problems that we desperately need to solve
rev3-8nt3edWLgIg-00005 i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of artificial intelligence
rev3-8vNIrPeRGlM-00001 it cracked open my world
rev3-8vNIrPeRGlM-00003 so they won't go for a walk they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat
rev3-8vNIrPeRGlM-00005 she would hide in the closet
rev3-8vNIrPeRGlM-00009 they want to know how often your dog gets outside
rev3-8vNIrPeRGlM-00010 they want to know how much exercise your dog is getting
rev3-8vNIrPeRGlM-00011 his name is lonnie hodge and he's a veteran of vietnam
rev3-95ovIJ3dsNk-00002 for hepatitis it was also two and a half times
rev3-95ovIJ3dsNk-00003 for depression it was four and a half times
rev3-95ovIJ3dsNk-00005 what kind of trauma am i talking about here
rev3-95ovIJ3dsNk-00006 children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
rev3-95ovIJ3dsNk-00009 well imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear
rev3-9B0PaSznWJE-00002 so thank you very much
rev3-9CqVYUOjHLw-00002 it's the war on terror
rev3-9JKy6ZfmBn0-00001 you don't get a chance to mess it up
rev3-9JKy6ZfmBn0-00002 one of them got caught up in the water
rev3-9RMx31GnNXY-00001 plus we have stem cells
rev3-9RMx31GnNXY-00002 i was able to do more things
rev3-9RMx31GnNXY-00003 i know i was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery
rev3-9RMx31GnNXY-00004 and when i was 10 i didn't realize how amazing it was
rev3-9TPFLHvn024-00002 there were no back doors
rev3-9YekkGz1E2k-00001 i had to do something
rev3-9YekkGz1E2k-00002 this fishing village was famous for sculpture
rev3-9kBKQS7J7xI-00001 i don't paint
rev3-9kBKQS7J7xI-00002 this is going to become really freaking obvious
rev3-9uOMectkCCs-00001 dan replies so often you won't even notice it
rev3-9uOMectkCCs-00002 and then something falls off the wall
rev3-9uOMectkCCs-00004 we all know what he's talking about
rev3-9uOMectkCCs-00005 that wasn't the case for me
rev3-9uOMectkCCs-00007 no more charge before use
rev3-AMVgX8cXsHA-00002 and that's bad
rev3-AO4In7d6XSc-00001 what about manipulation
rev3-AO4In7d6XSc-00002 so that's mobile manipulation
rev3-AO4In7d6XSc-00003 i love building robots
rev3-AWPrOvzzqZk-00002 and when you think about it it makes a lot of sense because forming a question is a really complex
rev3-AegIbt2j0sU-00001 and they also knew that they can tap into a workforce
rev3-AsSd2nmoKNA-00001 i tagged along with my neighbors
rev3-AsSd2nmoKNA-00002 and i said to myself i wanna get me one of them
rev3-AsSd2nmoKNA-00003 who wrote that
rev3-AsSd2nmoKNA-00004 i'll meet you there
rev3-B8rmi95pYL0-00002 the key here really is knowledge
rev3-BHY0FxzoKZE-00002 i tried everything
rev3-BHY0FxzoKZE-00003 maybe i did an experiment on myself without even knowing it
rev3-BImnT7lcLDE-00001 you just had to do things sometimes
rev3-BImnT7lcLDE-00002 and boy they were like what
rev3-BImnT7lcLDE-00003 how do you get to build those relationships
rev3-BImnT7lcLDE-00004 so we created a new school
rev3-BImnT7lcLDE-00006 but that doesn't mean that we can't
rev3-BQZKs75RMqM-00001 it's almost becoming the syntax of a new language
rev3-BhMKmovNjvc-00001 on the other hand statistics that's a subject that you could and should use
rev3-Bo8YN3oB0Cw-00002 this is what i'm supposed to naturally be able to do
rev3-Bo8YN3oB0Cw-00003 why is it not working
rev3-Bs86giWcjLA-00001 and you know what
rev3-Bs86giWcjLA-00002 they were right
rev3-Bs86giWcjLA-00004 it brings people together and it supports creativity and social cohesion
rev3-BvpmZktlBFs-00002 did you hear he has gone mad
rev3-BzeTjn0R2VY-00001 i mean everyone did
rev3-BzeTjn0R2VY-00003 again it will not happen overnight
rev3-BzeTjn0R2VY-00004 it needs to happen
rev3-CDsNZJTWw0w-00001 i have resources
rev3-CdZJ0SMbh10-00001 and is this really the solution
rev3-CgNx9Bgac1I-00002 so i went to my doctor
rev3-CgNx9Bgac1I-00003 but i'm not happy
rev3-ClfBxWPkBKU-00001 in other words a coroner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe
rev3-ClfBxWPkBKU-00003 and remember we had experience with this
rev3-ClfBxWPkBKU-00005 roughly 300 savings and loans involved roughly 600 senior officials
rev3-ClfBxWPkBKU-00008 that is not simply critical to our economy
rev3-ClfBxWPkBKU-00009 thank you very much
rev3-ClfBxWPkBKU-00010 what do we need to do
rev3-ClfBxWPkBKU-00011 what can we do in all of this
rev3-CxEqV8WtfOo-00001 i'm 27 years old
rev3-D8SSLLnV3W8-00001 that's more expensive
rev3-DCIL2nvU4x8-00001 and when we do the results will often surprise
rev3-DDaldVHUedI-00002 i wanted to stay in this relationship
rev3-DDaldVHUedI-00003 things were going well
rev3-DDaldVHUedI-00004 this is a really important chapter to me
rev3-DDaldVHUedI-00005 why are we skipping over this
rev3-DDaldVHUedI-00006 i went to the dean
rev3-DOgsYATbVSs-00001 but here's the thing
rev3-DOgsYATbVSs-00003 it's not like teaching them how to ride a bike
rev3-DOgsYATbVSs-00004 i don't know
rev3-DjeIpjhAqsM-00002 and that led me to this project
rev3-DjeIpjhAqsM-00003 we have to turn that around
rev3-DsrxbqFo41k-00002 so i went to church as often as i could
rev3-E0oPnS7rUwE-00001 it's a performance venue
rev3-E0oPnS7rUwE-00002 but it's not enough
rev3-E0oPnS7rUwE-00003 and they're not just focused on money
rev3-E0oPnS7rUwE-00006 i've built a career
rev3-E0oPnS7rUwE-00007 we are magic
rev3-E22icGCvGXk-00001 they're completely flat and they're basically cardboard characters
rev3-E22icGCvGXk-00004 i got about 3000 emails
rev3-E22icGCvGXk-00006 my own website
rev3-EGjxIS5MPUY-00001 it's always what it was and what it can be
rev3-EV3OmxrowWE-00001 they're not my children
rev3-EV3OmxrowWE-00003 and when we're unprepared we overreact
rev3-EV3OmxrowWE-00004 and i did not know what to say
rev3-EV3OmxrowWE-00007 we can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate locate
rev3-F3OhcpKSUBc-00001 and looking at that pattern
rev3-F3OhcpKSUBc-00004 he saw it written down somewhere
rev3-F3OhcpKSUBc-00006 and now we want to do a double double of the age wave coming through
rev3-F3OhcpKSUBc-00007 that's sort of the state of the art
rev3-F5h6ynoq8uM-00001 what's this guy talking about
rev3-F5h6ynoq8uM-00002 let me illustrate this
rev3-FD6CqD1kV8s-00001 and he's a bad guy
rev3-FD6CqD1kV8s-00003 there were others like myself who were full time
rev3-FD6CqD1kV8s-00004 it's not a dirty word
rev3-FD6CqD1kV8s-00005 the children were killed on the spot
rev3-FFG2rilqT2g-00003 well you get several things
rev3-FFG2rilqT2g-00004 the gas that they used at first in many cases was oxygen
rev3-FFG2rilqT2g-00005 so they added oxygen to methane gas
rev3-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00001 so what is an idea drawing
rev3-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00002 here i'm one person talking to you
rev3-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00003 you're all collective
rev3-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00007 and if it's completely okay what's the joke
rev3-FQEEMpzPZlY-00001 they change from person to person
rev3-FcmSmAwPkxg-00001 we've all done this
rev3-FcmSmAwPkxg-00005 when it's 10 degrees below zero
rev3-FcmSmAwPkxg-00006 there's love and there's friendship and there's protection
rev3-FcmSmAwPkxg-00007 you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive doses of chemotherapy
rev3-FcmSmAwPkxg-00008 we see it as a disruption of real life and important work
rev3-FcmSmAwPkxg-00010 she suffered so much
rev3-FcmSmAwPkxg-00012 could we merge
rev3-Fivy99RtMfM-00002 that's awful right
rev3-FmpIMt95ndU-00001 sort of leadership by humiliation
rev3-FmpIMt95ndU-00004 thanks for asking
rev3-FmpIMt95ndU-00005 i said where is he now
rev3-FqrLUtIFVjs-00001 so how does this work
rev3-FqrLUtIFVjs-00002 we change the economics for the bad guys
rev3-FxtSMZKMdes-00002 we have the right to respect
rev3-FxtSMZKMdes-00004 i'm a feminist but i'm a rather bad one
rev3-FxtSMZKMdes-00005 i am full of contradictions
rev3-FxtSMZKMdes-00006 i want no part of any of that
rev3-FxtSMZKMdes-00007 i enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things
rev3-FxtSMZKMdes-00009 we go far beyond reasonable constructive criticism to dissecting any given woman's feminism
rev3-FxtSMZKMdes-00010 they are gorgeous and headstrong brilliant girls who are a whole lot of brave
rev3-FxtSMZKMdes-00014 some boys broke me when i was so young i did not know what boys can do to break a girl
rev3-FxtSMZKMdes-00015 i learned to write like them and then i learned to write as myself
rev3-FxtSMZKMdes-00017 i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such bravery
rev3-G2XBIkHW954-00002 we're seeing the baby brain
rev3-GAMR5RDSLJo-00005 lots of money
rev3-GAMR5RDSLJo-00006 supporting local economies
rev3-GAMR5RDSLJo-00007 it's a top predator
rev3-GAMR5RDSLJo-00009 i love red wine
rev3-GAMR5RDSLJo-00010 i'm going to be so healthy
rev3-GAMR5RDSLJo-00011 i want to know how i impact them
rev3-GAMR5RDSLJo-00014 i want to know how they impact me
rev3-GAMR5RDSLJo-00016 so let's start there
rev3-GAMR5RDSLJo-00018 i made more money
rev3-GAMR5RDSLJo-00019 this is great
rev3-GAMR5RDSLJo-00020 we've seen an image of our blue planet our world bank
rev3-GGScU5ESei4-00001 but there's actually more to the story than that
rev3-GGScU5ESei4-00004 what's different is how the molecules are put together
rev3-GGScU5ESei4-00005 the oil will never run out
rev3-GIbz9ms9Z9k-00001 you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might go wrong
rev3-GIbz9ms9Z9k-00003 they want a treatment
rev3-GIbz9ms9Z9k-00004 we are all responsible
rev3-GMynksvCcUI-00001 my father worked at this factory he said
rev3-GMynksvCcUI-00002 my grandfather worked at this factory
rev3-GMynksvCcUI-00008 why not ask all of the states to do that instead
rev3-GMynksvCcUI-00009 and imagine what might happen because every region has something to offer
rev3-GSf6nijSSdA-00002 i've tried engaging people
rev3-GSf6nijSSdA-00003 and he surprised me by saying you know what
rev3-GSf6nijSSdA-00004 patriarchy is not boys and men
rev3-GSf6nijSSdA-00005 that allowed me to take a stand for myself
rev3-GSf6nijSSdA-00007 i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse including three
rev3-GSf6nijSSdA-00010 and guess what silicon valley
rev3-GSf6nijSSdA-00011 so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
rev3-GZadCj8O1S0-00001 so that's it for now
rev3-Gmai4zkKNcM-00001 it came from the way in which beijing has grown as a city
rev3-Gmai4zkKNcM-00002 that's really important
rev3-Gmai4zkKNcM-00003 and we couldn't just turn it off
rev3-Gmai4zkKNcM-00004 you're in there
rev3-Gmai4zkKNcM-00006 but the second of the transformations the climate transformations we have to decide to do
rev3-Gmai4zkKNcM-00007 we can see how to do that
rev3-GqnJFm1CS3c-00002 don't get me wrong it's not like we don't have comedy in the middle east
rev3-GvGAIGbnX7E-00001 they have to be able to teach us something as well
rev3-GvGAIGbnX7E-00004 and in that i need a surgery lexicon
rev3-H14bBuluwB8-00001 my research team and i went to west point military academy
rev3-H14bBuluwB8-00002 that's the work that stands before us
rev3-H9ZOpQzjukY-00001 we're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
rev3-HD4bpztESWw-00001 we're on the grid
rev3-HI7zfpitZpo-00002 who or what inspires you and why
rev3-HSercnrqeN4-00001 i exist because i have my women friends
rev3-HSercnrqeN4-00002 i don't know about you
rev3-HSercnrqeN4-00004 and guess what
rev3-HUM2rCIUdeI-00001 i looked at slaves
rev3-HUM2rCIUdeI-00003 there's no need to play the market
rev3-HUM2rCIUdeI-00004 it's not a lot of money at the global level
rev3-HbUeAdVXOVc-00001 this is the only part that's battery backed up
rev3-HdwOlk6HIVc-00001 and germany and france
rev3-HdwOlk6HIVc-00002 4 times the mass of the sun
rev3-HdwOlk6HIVc-00004 surely we know enough
rev3-HiwJ0hNl1Fw-00002 the same tool that united us to topple dictators
rev3-HiwJ0hNl1Fw-00003 i was terrified
rev3-Hj9oB4zpHww-00001 what is worth dying for
rev3-Hj9oB4zpHww-00003 that is what it is to have a domain of expertise
rev3-HqekWfSJCSA-00002 we can change our minds
rev3-Ht2fzax9wV0-00001 you need to be able to do something with it
rev3-Ht2fzax9wV0-00002 we're always trying to make it faster
rev3-IPBCxlxSSVk-00001 we will not be there
rev3-IS4IK8CiLg8-00001 what is that
rev3-IS4IK8CiLg8-00002 she contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work
rev3-IThAD5yKrgE-00001 it's not exactly rocket science
rev3-IWdzrZdRa38-00001 it's changed the way we talk
rev3-IWdzrZdRa38-00004 the board of ed
rev3-IWdzrZdRa38-00005 had no idea
rev3-IWdzrZdRa38-00006 they don't trust the law
rev3-IWdzrZdRa38-00007 why don't they trust the law
rev3-IWdzrZdRa38-00012 it's not true
rev3-IjbTiRbeNpM-00001 that was the only way to get anything done
rev3-IjbTiRbeNpM-00002 that's available right now
rev3-IjbTiRbeNpM-00003 art is not efficient
rev3-IjbTiRbeNpM-00004 human relationships are not efficient
rev3-IjbTiRbeNpM-00005 efficiency is for robots
rev3-Ip2SQa50uBI-00001 china is the world's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades
rev3-Ip2SQa50uBI-00003 how else can we create new ideas
rev3-Ip2SQa50uBI-00005 but some of our grandchildren probably will
rev3-J8FyHI00ELY-00001 that's what happened with my dad
rev3-J8FyHI00ELY-00002 my dad has alzheimer's disease
rev3-J8FyHI00ELY-00004 they get scared to walk around
rev3-J8FyHI00ELY-00005 they get scared to move
rev3-J8FyHI00ELY-00006 i'm trying to become a better person
rev3-J8FyHI00ELY-00008 even when it's so hard
rev3-J8FyHI00ELY-00009 and what i need now is to learn to be like that
rev3-JFQLvbVJVMg-00001 so this is obvious right
rev3-JFQLvbVJVMg-00003 so what's women's experience as it relates to mentoring
rev3-JHk9YVjhk7c-00001 is it that i write very well
rev3-JISHzvXk5bk-00001 quite the opposite
rev3-JP0w9lZoLwU-00002 thank you very much
rev3-JSSc7hYKstI-00005 especially when it comes to climate change
rev3-JSSc7hYKstI-00006 so i want to talk to you today about what i think is a much more complete recipe for deep
rev3-JSSc7hYKstI-00007 this meant that the movements demanding change knew what they were against crushing poverty widening
rev3-JSSc7hYKstI-00008 progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
rev3-JSSc7hYKstI-00010 well very often we think about political change in defined compartments these days
rev3-JSSc7hYKstI-00014 what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what its core values are
rev3-JSSc7hYKstI-00015 a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish
rev3-JSSc7hYKstI-00016 so we locked ourselves in a room for two days and we tried to figure out what bound us together
rev3-JSSc7hYKstI-00017 well we rejected all of that
rev3-JSSc7hYKstI-00019 but in the process they also train our brains to tune out when somebody else's issue
rev3-JTN9Nx8VYtk-00002 i don't have an answer
rev3-Jc9RdbHEFa0-00001 i don't know
rev3-JcJ3MfJNm6g-00001 the science is there
rev3-Jm2dWbNsnZI-00001 let's think about your ethical footprint
rev3-Jm2dWbNsnZI-00002 but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
rev3-KNSRifMSSvM-00001 and he wanted one so badly
rev3-KPNn880KWfU-00003 which brings me to my second point
rev3-KPNn880KWfU-00005 i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
rev3-KuWXfjyGhk0-00001 a huge opportunity unleashing of new potential for innovation for development
rev3-KuWXfjyGhk0-00004 there will be invisible capacity
rev3-KuWXfjyGhk0-00005 but the question is who will have it
rev3-KuWXfjyGhk0-00007 of course migration will become even more important
rev3-KuWXfjyGhk0-00009 and this change is getting more rapid
rev3-KvvjDOtS2sw-00005 i didn't always succeed
rev3-KvvjDOtS2sw-00006 i hadn't bathed in three days
rev3-KvvjDOtS2sw-00007 why are you really here
rev3-KvvjDOtS2sw-00010 and i cried
rev3-KvvjDOtS2sw-00012 i was winning awards
rev3-KvvjDOtS2sw-00013 i was living in my own apartment
rev3-KvvjDOtS2sw-00014 i was no longer homeless
rev3-KxLMjn4WPBY-00001 race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences
rev3-KxLMjn4WPBY-00002 i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to
rev3-LEx6K4P4GJc-00001 i know platforms i know computers they put me on the internet when i was young
rev3-LEx6K4P4GJc-00003 what would that change about how we live
rev3-LEx6K4P4GJc-00004 what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
rev3-LEx6K4P4GJc-00005 a digital world farm
rev3-LEx6K4P4GJc-00010 why didn't you just tell me that
rev3-LHHlPnfOtRo-00001 well that's exciting
rev3-LIckScLypGA-00001 and dance has progressed
rev3-LIckScLypGA-00002 and this is happening every day
rev3-LIy2oVJtJsA-00002 they're not donated
rev3-LIy2oVJtJsA-00003 they're not heavily subsidized
rev3-LIy2oVJtJsA-00006 and use is what creates impact
rev3-LYCKzpXEW6E-00001 how could i come from a nation
rev3-LYCKzpXEW6E-00002 what kind of rituals are these
rev3-LYCKzpXEW6E-00003 the rituals were familiar
rev3-Li4S1yyrsTI-00001 why do i believe this
rev3-Li4S1yyrsTI-00003 and you know what else we did
rev3-Li4S1yyrsTI-00007 and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
rev3-Li4S1yyrsTI-00009 and so knowing that we went to the advertising council and we asked them to help us
rev3-Li4S1yyrsTI-00010 we were making what was invisible visible
rev3-Li4S1yyrsTI-00011 take a look at one of our spots
rev3-Li4S1yyrsTI-00013 and let me just put this in context
rev3-Li4S1yyrsTI-00014 we were obviously making a difference
rev3-Li4S1yyrsTI-00015 but we were still missing a critical element
rev3-Li4S1yyrsTI-00016 and that's what we did
rev3-Li4S1yyrsTI-00021 we met men where they were at and we built a program
rev3-Li4S1yyrsTI-00022 and he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving
rev3-LiUClSItcy0-00001 texting has a 100 percent open rate
rev3-LiUClSItcy0-00004 i think it might be a lifeline
rev3-LiUClSItcy0-00005 he told me not to tell anyone
rev3-LiUClSItcy0-00006 it's my dad
rev3-LiUClSItcy0-00007 that last one's an actual text message that we received
rev3-LiUClSItcy0-00008 i will not forget the day we got that text message
rev3-LiUClSItcy0-00009 and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline
rev3-LjAsM1vAhW0-00001 the nazis invaded the netherlands
rev3-LpROaNue9GM-00001 but when i was little i remember he would kill flies in our house with my bb gun
rev3-LujWrkYsl64-00002 it was like a star trek episode you know
rev3-M0SbSz5Le10-00002 i started off in uganda
rev3-M5PiTCwoQRo-00001 well not so fast
rev3-M6TMSQWI9m4-00001 i'm in tucson
rev3-M7KSnq0xkWY-00001 we have to throw it away
rev3-MIAS1xQc7x8-00002 we can do it again
rev3-MNuOmTQdFjA-00001 and i don't have to do anything
rev3-MNuOmTQdFjA-00002 so i looked for furniture
rev3-MsLuQM5V3FA-00001 my other great passion is the environment
rev3-MsLuQM5V3FA-00002 i was considered a radical
rev3-MsLuQM5V3FA-00005 so let's get started now
rev3-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00003 go i said again sweat forming on my brow
rev3-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00006 i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
rev3-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00007 science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writing
rev3-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00009 it was faulty and most of the time i had to restart it over and over before it worked
rev3-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00011 for africans homegrown science fiction can be a will to power
rev3-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00012 it is in the water
rev3-MvXZzKZ3JYQ-00001 my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach terminal cancer
rev3-NA7krbsdXFA-00002 we suspended our values
rev3-NA7krbsdXFA-00003 and what was the result of that
rev3-NA7krbsdXFA-00005 but it's not just china
rev3-NA7krbsdXFA-00010 where are the philosophers
rev3-NA7krbsdXFA-00011 and that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you
rev3-NCJTV5KaJJc-00001 last week alone i got 238 pieces of nasty email and more
rev3-NCJTV5KaJJc-00002 but i'm a big fan of you as a person
rev3-NL0uxDscjdo-00001 and so they took them to some safe place
rev3-NL0uxDscjdo-00004 and in fact what did happen to my brain
rev3-NL0uxDscjdo-00005 i understand how this could happen
rev3-NYKcOFQCeno-00001 and that might have been the case
rev3-NYKcOFQCeno-00003 and that leads to a very powerful tool
rev3-NoCOagL69Ss-00001 to me it's not that clear
rev3-NoCOagL69Ss-00002 that may not always be the case
rev3-NqOjj1FCcVY-00001 imagine if we had across the country right now in local places but
rev3-NqOjj1FCcVY-00003 let me tell you about a couple of them
rev3-NqOjj1FCcVY-00004 it's just a wall
rev3-NqOjj1FCcVY-00005 i have passion in my heart
rev3-NqOjj1FCcVY-00006 i can stand up and do something
rev3-NqOjj1FCcVY-00007 both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
rev3-O0JDDyqtSVY-00001 but you know what
rev3-O0JDDyqtSVY-00002 but you know what
rev3-O3a9AYu5SUQ-00001 and that's pretty amazing
rev3-O6Vayv9FCLM-00001 that option is actually not on the table
rev3-O6Vayv9FCLM-00002 so it's up to us
rev3-ODLgS00f9BE-00002 we could only think of one way
rev3-OIlSXRCSBSI-00001 i even read many self help books
rev3-OIlSXRCSBSI-00002 the first lesson is about humility
rev3-OIlSXRCSBSI-00006 try it and let me know how it works for you
rev3-OIlSXRCSBSI-00007 i would love to hear from you
rev3-OM6XIICmSqo-00001 who's at the event
rev3-OM6XIICmSqo-00002 whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that
rev3-OM6XIICmSqo-00005 i can use it in my company
rev3-ONM4JupBzSE-00001 it's right there for you to find
rev3-ONM4JupBzSE-00003 there's nothing underground about it
rev3-ONM4JupBzSE-00005 we only sell you airtime
rev3-ORthzIOEf30-00001 it was appalling
rev3-OYfoGTIG7pY-00001 pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you
rev3-OYfoGTIG7pY-00002 i remember what you said to me
rev3-OYfoGTIG7pY-00003 i am thinking of your love for me
rev3-OYfoGTIG7pY-00004 i am torn by your love for me
rev3-OYfoGTIG7pY-00007 remember what i said my love
rev3-OYfoGTIG7pY-00010 and i said i don't know
rev3-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00002 when you really look at it how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies
rev3-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00003 you learn more about how computers work
rev3-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00004 he wanted to keep score
rev3-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00005 but it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write
rev3-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00003 you board the plane
rev3-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00004 the plane takes off
rev3-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00005 the engine fails
rev3-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00008 no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
rev3-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00009 they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios
rev3-OzA6jRYjVQs-00001 it's about people
rev3-OzA6jRYjVQs-00003 this is not a statement on malnutrition or anything else
rev3-OzA6jRYjVQs-00004 the net outcome
rev3-OzA6jRYjVQs-00006 china is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has available for agriculture and it has massive
rev3-OzA6jRYjVQs-00008 that even small scale farmers can leverage
rev3-OzA6jRYjVQs-00009 we just need to act on it
rev3-P2AUat93a8Q-00002 would you like to create a second one together
rev3-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00001 we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
rev3-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00004 he wouldn't like the answer
rev3-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00005 or any national leader
rev3-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00006 the supreme court has fallen way down from what it used to be
rev3-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00007 they were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites
rev3-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00009 they are doing it together
rev3-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00011 that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or
rev3-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00012 we can create a global parliament of mayors
rev3-PYHd7rpOTe8-00001 but you know what the actual facts are
rev3-PYHd7rpOTe8-00002 but now it's turned around
rev3-PYHd7rpOTe8-00003 then they had to bring them in
rev3-PaxNc5Sqn6s-00001 make it about the other party
rev3-PbgB2TaYhio-00001 well i think about this all the time
rev3-PbgB2TaYhio-00003 they all look the same under a microscope i mean to a first approximation
rev3-PbgB2TaYhio-00004 but now check out where they go on our tree of life
rev3-PbgB2TaYhio-00007 it's just not possible
rev3-PhVP1tNeGyY-00001 how cool is that
rev3-PrK0CifulU0-00003 now hamilton was everything madison was not
rev3-PrK0CifulU0-00004 and they did it in the good old fashioned way
rev3-PrK0CifulU0-00005 first they founded political parties
rev3-Q6U69HbAF9Y-00002 well we bought one of these
rev3-QKHkSUiQboA-00003 it's kind of the anti reality tv
rev3-QKHkSUiQboA-00004 nobody comes to get famous
rev3-QKHkSUiQboA-00005 and it's hard and it takes courage but that's why we're alive right
rev3-QKHkSUiQboA-00007 how are we going to do that
rev3-QeIrdqU0o9s-00002 i am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye
rev3-QeIrdqU0o9s-00004 how far away was the finish line
rev3-QeIrdqU0o9s-00006 so this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster
rev3-QleRgTBMX88-00001 i think this is a problem
rev3-QleRgTBMX88-00002 beth israel's in boston
rev3-QoT0S2vu9m4-00001 that's a terrible waste of time
rev3-QoT0S2vu9m4-00002 do that only if you're paid by the hour
rev3-QoyBYYpal1Y-00001 so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system
rev3-QuIS7J59SYw-00001 that's my question
rev3-RAR4cz9wkUk-00001 i was not going to cry myself to sleep
rev3-RAR4cz9wkUk-00002 i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
rev3-RCXGpEmFbOw-00001 there are no external cameras
rev3-RD07GkmM2fc-00001 in fact it's more like five percent
rev3-RD07GkmM2fc-00004 and we finally figured out how to do it
rev3-RDIy58g9n2k-00002 it's just incredible
rev3-RDSSLJG7oi8-00001 i'm not strong enough to lift my carry on bag from the ground to the carousel
rev3-RE4ce4mexrU-00002 it's not one way
rev3-RE4ce4mexrU-00004 and i thought what am i thinking
rev3-RE4ce4mexrU-00005 he's five years old
rev3-ROgFmb3oTLo-00001 they have different interests
rev3-ROgFmb3oTLo-00002 they have divergent values
rev3-ROgFmb3oTLo-00004 it means for youth and it's a new arab tv channel
rev3-ROgFmb3oTLo-00005 but it's not about fire and brimstone either
rev3-ROgFmb3oTLo-00007 there is an animated series in the works
rev3-ROgFmb3oTLo-00010 and she's looking as young as ever
rev3-RaSlxoAUP5c-00001 i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one
rev3-RaSlxoAUP5c-00003 which means take my camera
rev3-RaSlxoAUP5c-00004 and he thinks i'm saying take my picture
rev3-RiM5aSvaNkg-00001 i went to extreme lengths to try to be straight
rev3-RiM5aSvaNkg-00002 and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this
rev3-RiM5aSvaNkg-00003 but if you won't move we'll have no choice but to run you down
rev3-RlQ3CSVanaU-00001 i don't understand
rev3-RplnSVTzvnU-00001 we can see everything on wikipedia
rev3-RplnSVTzvnU-00002 it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated
rev3-RplnSVTzvnU-00003 we can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly
rev3-Rw9s0ivfn3w-00001 because we can
rev3-S2Dj9M71JAc-00003 so when we met chuck was a senior in high school
rev3-S2Dj9M71JAc-00006 not a single one
rev3-S2Dj9M71JAc-00007 the question for us now is how much can we make of it
rev3-S2Dj9M71JAc-00008 how much can we change
rev3-S6ufvYWTqQ0-00001 he was also the first person to call me a feminist
rev3-S6ufvYWTqQ0-00005 my brothers are not as interested as i am
rev3-S7t6Ry4PlTo-00001 it's been thought about for a while
rev3-SE97Kgi0sR4-00001 think about that
rev3-SE97Kgi0sR4-00002 they also monitored the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
rev3-SE97Kgi0sR4-00003 terrorists are doing this
rev3-SE97Kgi0sR4-00004 when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob
rev3-SE97Kgi0sR4-00005 of course we're going to go even deeper than the human body
rev3-SE97Kgi0sR4-00006 we're going down to the cellular level these days
rev3-SFnMTHhKdkw-00003 we can do this
rev3-SFnMTHhKdkw-00004 i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the worst
rev3-SFnMTHhKdkw-00005 i'm so sorry
rev3-SFnMTHhKdkw-00008 one year i came up with a bright idea
rev3-SFnMTHhKdkw-00009 we know why kids don't learn
rev3-SFnMTHhKdkw-00010 you made it work for me
rev3-SN7wO06Yz1E-00002 and they put on an opera all night long
rev3-SN7wO06Yz1E-00003 what is the abstraction
rev3-SN7wO06Yz1E-00004 it's so obvious
rev3-SN7wO06Yz1E-00005 you don't question that
rev3-SN7wO06Yz1E-00006 that's what moves you
rev3-SN7wO06Yz1E-00008 i'm in the crucible right now
rev3-SN7wO06Yz1E-00009 i know you understand that
rev3-SS8TSf2srSw-00002 seventy five percent of them are women and children
rev3-SS8TSf2srSw-00003 that was her fight
rev3-SS8TSf2srSw-00006 she got a support network
rev3-SS8TSf2srSw-00007 she learned about her rights
rev3-SS8TSf2srSw-00008 she was doing okay
rev3-SSzRfSJTNW4-00001 what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary
rev3-SSzRfSJTNW4-00003 why do we need to study this anymore
rev3-SSzRfSJTNW4-00005 don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization
rev3-SSzRfSJTNW4-00006 indeed we run the risk of making things worse
rev3-SSzRfSJTNW4-00007 imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics
rev3-SWiwSBLXS3k-00001 and not just that
rev3-SWiwSBLXS3k-00002 they met together
rev3-SWiwSBLXS3k-00003 why is it important now
rev3-SWiwSBLXS3k-00008 so what did they do
rev3-SWvJxasiSZ8-00004 but people did not relate to this
rev3-SWvJxasiSZ8-00005 i don't know
rev3-SWvJxasiSZ8-00006 people started contributing ideas
rev3-SWvJxasiSZ8-00009 and that's actually what happened
rev3-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00001 you see there's a lot of things we just don't have data on
rev3-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00002 it's a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world
rev3-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00003 but we're not there yet
rev3-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00004 with that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen
rev3-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00008 data drives better decisions
rev3-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00010 it's a win all around
rev3-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00012 and that's a big deal for a profession that's in high demand
rev3-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00013 there's going to be a new system based on donated package tracking technology from the logistics company that i work for
rev3-SaouBn7IKIo-00001 we've been working together since well since we were kids really
rev3-SaouBn7IKIo-00002 which brought us to this
rev3-Sbm98rrVZzE-00001 but i need your help
rev3-Sddb0Khx0yA-00001 so what to do next
rev3-Sew0bn8mGAA-00002 the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place
rev3-Sew0bn8mGAA-00004 what do they have
rev3-Sew0bn8mGAA-00006 do they have aids
rev3-Sew0bn8mGAA-00007 do they have a common cold
rev3-Sew0bn8mGAA-00009 you make it flow under and over
rev3-Sktdq5z1NS4-00001 and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more
rev3-SmLeSPk3ddE-00001 take a look at these
rev3-SnSHsb5xKPo-00001 it took six days to deploy a global malware campaign
rev3-SnSHsb5xKPo-00002 it should be inspiring
rev3-SpTGUTSFvf4-00001 some did not everybody
rev3-SpTGUTSFvf4-00003 even that wasn't enough
rev3-SpTGUTSFvf4-00004 she wanted to change policy at the government level
rev3-SsqlpgMKjyU-00001 i actually have no idea why
rev3-SsqlpgMKjyU-00002 i didn't talk to them
rev3-SsqlpgMKjyU-00003 go pick up the keys
rev3-Sv5QitqbxJw-00003 they're too busy putting out daily fires to think ahead strategically
rev3-Sv5QitqbxJw-00004 and they don't need to ask for permission
rev3-TDaFwnOiKVE-00002 and i said that's a good job
rev3-TDaFwnOiKVE-00003 this isn't information
rev3-TDaFwnOiKVE-00004 it's super real and it's happening around you
rev3-TGZMSmcuiXM-00001 that's what's so complicated about war
rev3-TGZMSmcuiXM-00002 it was incredibly hot
rev3-TGZMSmcuiXM-00003 how does that work
rev3-TGZMSmcuiXM-00004 it's not what i had expected
rev3-TGZMSmcuiXM-00008 what is it that he misses
rev3-TGZMSmcuiXM-00009 we have to answer that
rev3-TGZMSmcuiXM-00012 the boys are up there for a year
rev3-TGZMSmcuiXM-00013 some of them got out of the army and had tremendous psychological problems when they got home
rev3-TRajLqEaWhQ-00002 that means at some point it's going to be your problem too
rev3-TScetimMBL8-00002 i realize of course that all countries are unique
rev3-TScetimMBL8-00003 that's nothing special
rev3-TScetimMBL8-00004 it had no choice
rev3-TScetimMBL8-00005 again it had no choice
rev3-TScetimMBL8-00006 just when that's the last thing you want to do
rev3-TUgBdSyK7S4-00001 i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
rev3-TUxwiVFgghE-00001 how much they do
rev3-TVtgb153S6I-00001 and we connected over really small things like the fact that i love country music which is really
rev3-TVtgb153S6I-00002 this is not a photo profile for your facebook
rev3-U6FvJ6jMGHU-00002 that didn't go over really well
rev3-U6FvJ6jMGHU-00003 so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free
rev3-U6PoUg7jXsA-00001 the answer was no
rev3-U6PoUg7jXsA-00002 do you remember what it was
rev3-U6PoUg7jXsA-00004 and i got pretty into it
rev3-U6PoUg7jXsA-00005 this is how stuff is made memorable
rev3-UAinLaT42xY-00001 what makes technology useful and usable
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00001 i will craft my own drum
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00003 i will not be played
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00006 we mourn women complicated
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00011 i live cycles of light and darkness
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00012 rhythm is half silence
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00013 i see now i never was one and not the other
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00014 sickness health tender violence
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00016 one woman loses her head
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00017 one woman feeds on trash
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00018 one woman shoots her face
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00019 one woman straps herself
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00020 one woman gives birth to a baby
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00021 one woman gives birth to borders
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00022 one woman no longer believes love will ever find her
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00023 one woman never did
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00024 where do refugee hearts go
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00025 faced with absence
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00027 my spine curves spiral
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00028 cluster bombs left behind
rev3-UAj1hsXp18c-00030 harvest contaminated tobacco
rev3-UAq4yBdSYZs-00001 so after 25 years i began to feel as though i was running dry
rev3-UAq4yBdSYZs-00002 they will sit in them forever
rev3-UK8ccWSZkic-00001 of those seven have nuclear weapons
rev3-ULNPLFrTirQ-00001 i'm pushing and pulling with this object
rev3-UMhLBPPtlrY-00002 she got unlucky
rev3-UMhLBPPtlrY-00004 what if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all
rev3-UMhLBPPtlrY-00005 that wasn't being asked
rev3-UZmXwOgNq7c-00001 only one percent of the people are actually farmers
rev3-UZmXwOgNq7c-00002 so what can we do
rev3-UZmXwOgNq7c-00005 talk to farmers
rev3-UmvOgW6iV2s-00001 casual speech is something quite different
rev3-UmvOgW6iV2s-00002 that's what texting is
rev3-UmvOgW6iV2s-00003 it's a marker of empathy
rev3-UmvOgW6iV2s-00004 any spoken language that's used by real people has them
rev3-UmvOgW6iV2s-00007 texting has developed one from this slash
rev3-Us70DN2XSfM-00001 like why did i really have to mow the lawn
rev3-Us70DN2XSfM-00002 you can't run around in the dark
rev3-Us70DN2XSfM-00003 you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
rev3-Us70DN2XSfM-00005 and it's not that they didn't want me to think critically
rev3-UtBsl3j0YRQ-00002 you haven't earned it
rev3-UtBsl3j0YRQ-00004 we have to get quiet
rev3-UtBsl3j0YRQ-00006 how can we do it
rev3-V1yW5IsnSjo-00001 i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trap disguised as love one
rev3-V1yW5IsnSjo-00003 which is why that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future
rev3-V1yW5IsnSjo-00004 and here's where those guns come in
rev3-V1yW5IsnSjo-00005 he kept one in the glove compartment of our car
rev3-V1yW5IsnSjo-00006 i had just graduated from harvard college
rev3-V1yW5IsnSjo-00008 the question why does she stay
rev3-V1yW5IsnSjo-00009 show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your coworkers your friends and
rev3-V4sSabKqyMU-00001 but there's so much potential
rev3-V4sSabKqyMU-00002 and i went back home and i said daddy i don't know who i am
rev3-V4sSabKqyMU-00003 so since then i've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
rev3-V4sSabKqyMU-00004 brought in younger men
rev3-V4sSabKqyMU-00005 it's about proving who you are and what you can do
rev3-V4sSabKqyMU-00006 and this is true
rev3-VAJS5J21Rd0-00001 are they attractive
rev3-VAJS5J21Rd0-00003 are they a potential mate
rev3-VAJS5J21Rd0-00004 when you're six maybe you can do that
rev3-VAJS5J21Rd0-00005 i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
rev3-VAJS5J21Rd0-00008 how old are you
rev3-VAJS5J21Rd0-00009 so i changed my immediate goal to 10000 faces
rev3-VIgzTLDyObo-00001 so momentum is good
rev3-VIgzTLDyObo-00002 often what happens is you're planning so hard for like how do i get through the hardest part
rev3-VIgzTLDyObo-00003 how do i get through the hardest part
rev3-VIgzTLDyObo-00004 and then what happens
rev3-VSLurJfOSiA-00001 and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things
rev3-VSLurJfOSiA-00002 you were born to
rev3-VSLurJfOSiA-00005 that's what we do
rev3-VfAiNX7jn9A-00001 young people as well
rev3-VfAiNX7jn9A-00004 and that's what we did
rev3-VfAiNX7jn9A-00006 we hear the chaos of war
rev3-VfAiNX7jn9A-00007 we hear terrorism
rev3-VfAiNX7jn9A-00010 the silent majority does not need to be silent
rev3-VfAiNX7jn9A-00011 let's help them have a voice
rev3-VfAiNX7jn9A-00012 thank you very much
rev3-VsjTVGIw4z8-00003 and we all know this
rev3-VsjTVGIw4z8-00005 okay then we can make a mobile geiger counter
rev3-VsjTVGIw4z8-00006 we can drive around
rev3-VsjTVGIw4z8-00007 we can get volunteers
rev3-VsjTVGIw4z8-00008 we don't have enough money
rev3-VxESitIllxE-00001 and then we were alarmed to discover something
rev3-VxESitIllxE-00002 no plankton means no fish
rev3-VxESitIllxE-00004 as an inventor i try and turn fantasy into reality
rev3-VxESitIllxE-00007 not when you get lung cancer
rev3-VzyjDRSAWzE-00001 it's an unconscious process
rev3-VzyjDRSAWzE-00002 it's an automatic process
rev3-WFCvkkDSfIU-00002 one way around this is to draw pictures
rev3-WFCvkkDSfIU-00003 and this idea is actually nothing new
rev3-WT7VMrxTPPA-00001 there's no other way
rev3-WT7VMrxTPPA-00003 i mean i thought poetry was just self expression
rev3-WT7VMrxTPPA-00004 i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
rev3-WTFi99e4RXU-00001 only we don't know that it's a homeless shelter
rev3-XBJQENjZJaA-00001 5 percent today
rev3-XBJQENjZJaA-00002 how is that possible
rev3-XBJQENjZJaA-00003 that's different from actually having an effective ad campaign
rev3-XESFPEFpHt4-00001 where would it go
rev3-XESFPEFpHt4-00002 you can walk around them
rev3-XESFPEFpHt4-00003 was the internet actually a place that you could visit
rev3-XESFPEFpHt4-00004 could i go there
rev3-XESFPEFpHt4-00005 who would i meet
rev3-XESFPEFpHt4-00007 the whole internet
rev3-XESFPEFpHt4-00008 is it heavy
rev3-XESFPEFpHt4-00010 i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for
rev3-XESFPEFpHt4-00011 you can experience their sense of place
rev3-XESFPEFpHt4-00013 we let other people worry about it
rev3-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00001 so i learned never to move
rev3-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00005 it would skip a beat
rev3-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00006 it would start
rev3-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00007 it would stop
rev3-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00008 and i felt all this
rev3-XNbaR54Gpj4-00001 does any of this matter
rev3-XYNUpQrZISc-00001 why is that hard
rev3-XYNUpQrZISc-00002 that will change everything when we see that
rev3-YD5PFdghryc-00001 and so many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where i would walk across borders
rev3-YyXRYgjQXX0-00001 the answer to that question is a very definitive
rev3-YyXRYgjQXX0-00002 and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers that i would never sell them one of our crappy products
rev3-YyXRYgjQXX0-00007 it's all about what can you do for me
rev3-YyXRYgjQXX0-00008 agreeable people are warm and friendly they're nice they're polite
rev3-YyXRYgjQXX0-00010 whereas giving and taking are more of your inner motives what are your values
rev3-YyXRYgjQXX0-00011 what are your intentions toward others
rev3-YyXRYgjQXX0-00013 they'll say i'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks
rev3-YzGjO5aHShQ-00002 and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the
rev3-YzGjO5aHShQ-00004 i was talking about interaction design
rev3-YzGjO5aHShQ-00005 and does it matter
rev3-YzGjO5aHShQ-00006 you know it's like once again there's this whole problem of design being often misunderstood for art
rev3-YzGjO5aHShQ-00007 designers aspire to be really great designers
rev3-YzGjO5aHShQ-00012 what we want what we aspire to is the code
rev3-YzGjO5aHShQ-00013 it's very hard to get of course
rev3-YzGjO5aHShQ-00016 we're going to stay with them forever
rev3-YzGjO5aHShQ-00017 i mean that interface is beautiful
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00001 it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in trenton
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00002 now at that time camden new jersey was the most dangerous city in america
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00003 i ran the camden police department because of that
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00004 and they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00005 and one of them said we had a robbery two weeks ago
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00007 we have no suspects
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00008 we have no suspects
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00012 it worked for the oakland a's and it worked in the state of new jersey
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00013 we took camden off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in america
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00016 and all of this matters greatly because public safety to me is the most important function of
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00019 they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00020 they're just waiting for their day in court
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00021 and 67 percent of people come back
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00023 so when i started my job at the arnold foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00024 and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i feel the exact same way that i did about the state of
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00025 so i decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make the most critical decision
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00026 it impacts everything
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00027 it impacts sentencing
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00029 it impacts crime and violence
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00030 and when i talk to judges around the united states which i do all the time now they all say the same
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00031 but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00033 and i couldn't get this information out
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00035 and at the other end of the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00037 they're like the baseball scouts 20 years ago
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00044 some people call it data science
rev3-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00047 they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
rev3-Zd71719SG8Y-00001 thank you very much
rev3-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00001 but things have changed
rev3-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00004 but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
rev3-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00006 and that's exactly what that is
rev3-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00007 we do train them however to adjust caution according to where they are
rev3-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00008 out to dinner with family
rev3-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00009 you remember carlos
rev3-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00010 he wanted to sit where he could scan the room where he could plan escape routes where he could get his hands
rev3-Zo62S0ulqhA-00001 how do you change your behavior
rev3-Zo62S0ulqhA-00003 he could come over and help me
rev3-aSavBsX60Ss-00001 and it doesn't
rev3-aSavBsX60Ss-00003 so naturally i asked what is african
rev3-akiQuyhXR8o-00001 i don't look different
rev3-akiQuyhXR8o-00002 i'm not short
rev3-akiQuyhXR8o-00003 again let's just play
rev3-akiQuyhXR8o-00004 i needed an education
rev3-akiQuyhXR8o-00005 now i'm ready for my interview
rev3-akiQuyhXR8o-00006 i was right there with you
rev3-akiQuyhXR8o-00007 did i get my upgrade
rev3-akiQuyhXR8o-00010 we must adopt that way of giving back
rev3-akiQuyhXR8o-00011 that doesn't probably happen every day
rev3-aoGJP02CtPA-00002 if any child is found violating these rules he is severely reprimanded
rev3-aoGJP02CtPA-00003 effectively the taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information
rev3-aoGJP02CtPA-00004 their parents are so poor they have no resources to get them back
rev3-aupPrDnhrKA-00001 thank you for your time
rev3-aupPrDnhrKA-00002 i'll let you continue
rev3-b6YTQJVzwlI-00001 so what happens next
rev3-bArH8r8jJ4g-00001 it turns out the evidence says otherwise
rev3-bArH8r8jJ4g-00002 none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people
rev3-bArH8r8jJ4g-00004 it's a pretty simple idea right
rev3-bS6SiVz1R0o-00001 it is the default option
rev3-bS6SiVz1R0o-00002 you just move away
rev3-bS6SiVz1R0o-00003 you're more cautious
rev3-bS6SiVz1R0o-00004 and you walk around and it points to things
rev3-c0KYU2j0TM4-00001 that is great
rev3-c0KYU2j0TM4-00002 thank you very much
rev3-c64M1tZyWPM-00001 so why is it
rev3-c64M1tZyWPM-00002 why aren't people washing their hands
rev3-c64M1tZyWPM-00003 did you learn to wash your hands at home
rev3-c64M1tZyWPM-00004 did you learn to wash your hands in school
rev3-c9V6OKlY80k-00001 but i love it for a totally different reason
rev3-c9V6OKlY80k-00002 they make sense of the past
rev3-cHRZ6OrSvvI-00001 three billion people today with cell phones can't access the internet
rev3-cHRZ6OrSvvI-00002 don't create solutions to impress customers
rev3-cmpu58yv8Sg-00001 we harbor bias
rev3-cmpu58yv8Sg-00002 we know that we are right and they are wrong
rev3-cmpu58yv8Sg-00004 well that's what i thought
rev3-cmpu58yv8Sg-00005 if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video for example your answer
rev3-cmpu58yv8Sg-00007 harness your internal strength
rev3-d3syTrElgcg-00001 look at the end to see the animal
rev3-d6NKdnZvdoo-00002 just think about it
rev3-d6NKdnZvdoo-00003 but it's a global phenomenon
rev3-dS8n24ZwZcQ-00001 one billion people
rev3-dS8n24ZwZcQ-00002 but the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate
rev3-dYNc3P4jSt4-00001 so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
rev3-dYNc3P4jSt4-00004 she never had to duck and cover under her desk at school
rev3-dYNc3P4jSt4-00006 but before that cooperation could be realized kennedy was assassinated and that part of the
rev3-dYNc3P4jSt4-00007 but it's also an important date for another reason
rev3-dYNc3P4jSt4-00008 have inspired a generation of innovators
rev3-ddxHlkIuHqg-00001 i'm a doctor
rev3-ddxHlkIuHqg-00002 but too often my treatments made them feel worse
rev3-ddxHlkIuHqg-00004 we can do that because we know
rev3-eNAHVnkll5M-00001 who cleans up after us
rev3-eNAHVnkll5M-00002 i wanted to get to know them as individuals
rev3-eNAHVnkll5M-00003 i wanted to understand who takes the job
rev3-eNAHVnkll5M-00004 so i started a research project with them
rev3-eNAHVnkll5M-00005 it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
rev3-eNAHVnkll5M-00008 the economy needs them
rev3-eNAHVnkll5M-00011 take a moment to say thank you
rev3-eVFYhbHpfqU-00001 please sign here right now
rev3-eVFYhbHpfqU-00002 why does a jellyfish emit light
rev3-eVFYhbHpfqU-00003 or a firefly
rev3-eVFYhbHpfqU-00007 and that's powerful
rev3-eVFYhbHpfqU-00008 no not how much
rev3-eVFYhbHpfqU-00009 it's more annoying
rev3-eVFYhbHpfqU-00011 it goes wrong
rev3-eZj5n8ScTkI-00001 i couldn't tear myself away from the coverage
rev3-eZj5n8ScTkI-00002 and others resented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights and
rev3-eZj5n8ScTkI-00003 and this wasn't just an abstract question
rev3-eZj5n8ScTkI-00005 african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded
rev3-emW1TQ290ec-00001 can we really scale this up
rev3-eqsXcSaefKI-00001 everything in the universe wears out
rev3-eqsXcSaefKI-00002 and that blew my mind
rev3-esD6aaIjhek-00001 they don't have meaning
rev3-fC9da6eqaqg-00001 you're doing incredibly important work
rev3-fIICVeGW4RY-00001 you are a healer in a stone age village
rev3-fIICVeGW4RY-00003 but eventually they did come around
rev3-fIICVeGW4RY-00004 and so it's perfect for something like that
rev3-fIICVeGW4RY-00006 we need to see beyond the surface
rev3-fTSXvLzNd0o-00002 there won't be a single moment in the schedule
rev3-fZ8eyWBQmfU-00001 now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic
rev3-fscaRh2OtXk-00002 i am sick to my stomach
rev3-fscaRh2OtXk-00003 how do you know for sure
rev3-fscaRh2OtXk-00004 we created a diagnostic test
rev3-fxbCHn6gE3U-00001 i'm the opposite
rev3-fxbCHn6gE3U-00003 then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are
rev3-fxbCHn6gE3U-00005 so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get better at my job i just need to upgrade my browser
rev3-fxbCHn6gE3U-00007 they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all
rev3-fxbCHn6gE3U-00008 they have bad ideas
rev3-gSycQufrgK4-00001 that's next to impossible
rev3-gSycQufrgK4-00002 so i went in that direction
rev3-gVfgkFaswn4-00001 this is a crisis that's getting worse day by day
rev3-gVfgkFaswn4-00002 so the answer to the second question can we change
rev3-gVfgkFaswn4-00003 we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
rev3-gVfgkFaswn4-00006 but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is
rev3-gtpTd3ywwiE-00001 but that's kind of a big problem
rev3-hQigUH0vZSE-00001 and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
rev3-hiIcwt88o94-00001 i just disagree with this
rev3-hiIcwt88o94-00002 like we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share
rev3-hiIcwt88o94-00003 and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity man or woman
rev3-hiIcwt88o94-00005 i want to go
rev3-hiIcwt88o94-00006 and i was like oh the amazon
rev3-hiIcwt88o94-00008 they grow crops
rev3-hiIcwt88o94-00010 there's people everywhere
rev3-hiIcwt88o94-00017 and this is crazy
rev3-hiIcwt88o94-00018 and i'm sure the figures are similar in other countries
rev3-hiIcwt88o94-00019 every kid lives near nature
rev3-hiIcwt88o94-00020 we've just somehow forgotten how to see it
rev3-hiIcwt88o94-00023 there's pollination going on
rev3-hxsnKwmW0dk-00002 we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
rev3-hxsnKwmW0dk-00003 i have an idea for saving the world
rev3-iPE2SiCCo0w-00001 most of my friends were taking japanese
rev3-iPE2SiCCo0w-00002 so i thought why not punish myself
rev3-iPE2SiCCo0w-00004 i was always very small
rev3-iPE2SiCCo0w-00007 so water was something that scared me to begin with
rev3-iPE2SiCCo0w-00008 but i would go in on occasion
rev3-iPE2SiCCo0w-00009 and i thought this would be great fun
rev3-iPE2SiCCo0w-00013 and this routine went on for some time
rev3-iPE2SiCCo0w-00015 i tried everything
rev3-iPE2SiCCo0w-00018 and this became my holy grail my rosetta stone
rev3-iPE2SiCCo0w-00021 and now i love languages
rev3-iPE2SiCCo0w-00023 i know nothing
rev3-iqEHuBST2qQ-00001 and then i thought there's got to be a better way
rev3-j7fRIGphgtk-00001 well i didn't have any idea
rev3-j7fRIGphgtk-00002 our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
rev3-j7fRIGphgtk-00004 i had to have faith
rev3-j7fRIGphgtk-00005 it would be a mall and not a park
rev3-jPf0LjZAS14-00001 is it about earning as much as you possibly can
rev3-jPf0LjZAS14-00003 how should we work
rev3-jPf0LjZAS14-00004 how should we live
rev3-jPf0LjZAS14-00008 we need portable health benefits
rev3-jPf0LjZAS14-00009 i would never want to do that
rev3-jPf0LjZAS14-00010 we need to reinvent labor organizing
rev3-jbHpF7EySck-00001 they want to be part of it
rev3-jbHpF7EySck-00002 and they say i want to work in global poverty but what will it mean about my career
rev3-jcSSY9rDN2g-00001 there's a flip side as well
rev3-jcSSY9rDN2g-00002 it's shocking to realize that only 28 percent of american
rev3-jcp5vvxtEaU-00001 how do you get informed
rev3-jcp5vvxtEaU-00002 we paid two to three times more than anybody else
rev3-jcp5vvxtEaU-00004 there's no more of it
rev3-jcp5vvxtEaU-00006 let's go back and visit our equation
rev3-jcp5vvxtEaU-00008 we're not going to be able to do that
rev3-jcp5vvxtEaU-00009 even if we get everybody working on it we've got to be strategic
rev3-jcp5vvxtEaU-00010 so we did the analysis again a slightly different way
rev3-jcp5vvxtEaU-00011 so it's the demand that brings them to the table
rev3-jcp5vvxtEaU-00012 sustainability has got to be a pre competitive issue
rev3-jggHw5PdQV0-00001 and my whole world did open up
rev3-jggHw5PdQV0-00002 and who does that benefit
rev3-jggHw5PdQV0-00003 we now have a platform
rev3-jiUKpX09zo4-00001 it really is quite phenomenal
rev3-jtVIDBs60S8-00001 that was powerful
rev3-jtVIDBs60S8-00004 it's actually not that hard
rev3-jtVIDBs60S8-00005 raise your hands
rev3-k2hQL9Zrokk-00001 take my child
rev3-k2hQL9Zrokk-00002 i believe a story there has to be told
rev3-k2hQL9Zrokk-00003 they don't get their money out
rev3-k2hQL9Zrokk-00005 she worked in a bank
rev3-k2hQL9Zrokk-00006 i have to report it
rev3-k2hQL9Zrokk-00008 who cares about bosnia
rev3-kEKzl6fub2w-00001 which incidentally is only a third correct
rev3-kEKzl6fub2w-00002 i don't mean giving up the internet
rev3-kEKzl6fub2w-00003 this is your chance
rev3-ka8L1YMR88U-00001 that didn't happen to me
rev3-ka8L1YMR88U-00004 make it go away
rev3-ka8L1YMR88U-00005 make it go away
rev3-ka8L1YMR88U-00006 make it go away
rev3-ka8L1YMR88U-00008 we can't identify with that part
rev3-kcEIsbO0ivA-00001 you might get impeached for that
rev3-kwYxHPXIaao-00001 well not yet
rev3-l5vZHuAtDZA-00001 well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
rev3-l5vZHuAtDZA-00003 so was mother teresa
rev3-lmyZMtPVodo-00001 that is some deep deep emotion when you would want to do that
rev3-lmyZMtPVodo-00002 we have no control over these forces
rev3-lrSmXnUoUXM-00002 well guess what
rev3-lrSmXnUoUXM-00003 now i know why i'm here
rev3-m6X1i8khmt8-00001 and i was really scared
rev3-m6X1i8khmt8-00002 the irony is so obvious right
rev3-m6X1i8khmt8-00004 but i found one
rev3-mSHBma0Ithk-00001 they want to get out
rev3-mSHBma0Ithk-00002 allow many people to come in
rev3-mSHBma0Ithk-00003 let us have a hong kong nearby
rev3-mSHBma0Ithk-00006 when we share ideas we all get more
rev3-mc0vhSseGk4-00001 so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really
rev3-mgcjr1yz7ow-00002 is it about systems
rev3-mgcjr1yz7ow-00003 is it about equality
rev3-mgcjr1yz7ow-00005 i started looking at them really carefully
rev3-mgcjr1yz7ow-00006 i looked at my friend who drilled seven dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
rev3-mgcjr1yz7ow-00008 these guys could be true to their purpose which was finding oil and gas
rev3-mgcjr1yz7ow-00009 and they were basically having fun
rev3-mgcjr1yz7ow-00013 we need to be part of a community to survive
rev3-mgcjr1yz7ow-00015 it's very hard to make them part of our rational decision
rev3-mgcjr1yz7ow-00016 we all know deep inside what the answer is
rev3-mgcjr1yz7ow-00017 we've known since we were babies
rev3-mjDjbJJlqZ0-00001 we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place
rev3-mxNpNuogqsY-00003 what are the researchers learning
rev3-mxNpNuogqsY-00004 so i was jealous
rev3-mxNpNuogqsY-00005 i know i didn't
rev3-mxNpNuogqsY-00006 i think i'm a normal person
rev3-n3kNlFMXslo-00002 that's like finding an extra hour in the day
rev3-n3kNlFMXslo-00003 yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found
rev3-n3kNlFMXslo-00005 so how do we do that
rev3-n3kNlFMXslo-00006 but you can write it
rev3-n3kNlFMXslo-00010 you say you're working more than 60 hours
rev3-n3kNlFMXslo-00011 well are you sure
rev3-n3kNlFMXslo-00012 and that's even if you're working way more than full time hours
rev3-n3kNlFMXslo-00013 we don't even need that much time to do amazing things
rev3-nASJ0510Pxs-00002 so they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them
rev3-nASJ0510Pxs-00003 thanks very much
rev3-nCg2NcGYu34-00001 why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
rev3-nCg2NcGYu34-00004 he also had 11 children
rev3-nCg2NcGYu34-00006 not the wife not the kids
rev3-nCg2NcGYu34-00008 i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
rev3-nCg2NcGYu34-00009 please look at me
rev3-nCg2NcGYu34-00011 who is going to inherit his name and his fortune
rev3-nCg2NcGYu34-00012 he should not have been surprised
rev3-nG3vB2CuSjM-00001 not right now
rev3-ni4FV5zL6lM-00001 government officials are extremely mad
rev3-ni4FV5zL6lM-00003 but those surveillance features come at a cost
rev3-npNYP2vzaPo-00001 how can we get so much information out of so little motion
rev3-npNYP2vzaPo-00002 we would just get noise back
rev3-npNYP2vzaPo-00004 we push and pull and poke and prod things
rev3-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00001 how do you find a dinosaur
rev3-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00002 that's the magic of the geological record
rev3-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00003 but we only get one history and it's the one that we have
rev3-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00004 but this particular reality was not inevitable
rev3-oDNgnrtSD8w-00001 come on man
rev3-oYp5XuGYqqY-00002 we were wrong
rev3-oYp5XuGYqqY-00003 now that's a very very good point
rev3-ooAIIeo4AJQ-00001 you smell money
rev3-ooAIIeo4AJQ-00002 we wouldn't tolerate that
rev3-ooAIIeo4AJQ-00003 thank you very much
rev3-os69gEFXUW4-00001 what can i learn with you
rev3-pFDoCLf96Kg-00001 and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance
rev3-pnv5iKB2hl4-00001 i don't care
rev3-psN1DORYYV0-00002 at what point did i think that was a good idea
rev3-psN1DORYYV0-00004 she said yeah
rev3-psN1DORYYV0-00005 why did you bring this up
rev3-psN1DORYYV0-00006 have you lost your mind
rev3-psN1DORYYV0-00008 i'm a fifth generation texan
rev3-psN1DORYYV0-00012 it's the best way to shut people down on an airplane
rev3-psN1DORYYV0-00013 what do you do
rev3-psN1DORYYV0-00014 i study shame
rev3-psN1DORYYV0-00016 i guess i'm doing it right now
rev3-psN1DORYYV0-00017 your wife left you
rev3-psN1DORYYV0-00018 i made a mistake
rev3-psN1DORYYV0-00019 and here's what you need to know
rev3-psN1DORYYV0-00020 he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms
rev3-q2gO4DKVpa8-00001 i am certainly not the hardest working
rev3-q2gO4DKVpa8-00002 i was a mediocre student
rev3-q2gO4DKVpa8-00004 it has never happened
rev3-q2gO4DKVpa8-00005 i was the first non family investor in amazon
rev3-q2gO4DKVpa8-00006 this is nonsense
rev3-qWNae7vYK6s-00001 thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame
rev3-qWNae7vYK6s-00002 and when she went to complain to a major he said what
rev3-qWNae7vYK6s-00003 again in a car
rev3-qWNae7vYK6s-00004 i was petrified
rev3-qWNae7vYK6s-00006 sexual harassment doesn't discriminate
rev3-qWNae7vYK6s-00007 not a lot of hands
rev3-qWNae7vYK6s-00008 you don't get the same witnesses or depositions
rev3-qWNae7vYK6s-00009 they just do it
rev3-qYUmI5kGsYk-00001 so we need the solutions and these people playing the game they are trying out
rev3-qafSjNLjedo-00001 and we've all heard that kind of story before right
rev3-qlty0OPcU6k-00001 now do something different
rev3-qlty0OPcU6k-00002 that would not work
rev3-qsJYrwzfd6w-00004 and after that initial prototype we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have
rev3-qsJYrwzfd6w-00005 and then guess what
rev3-qsJYrwzfd6w-00006 could we leverage the cloud
rev3-qsJYrwzfd6w-00007 so why don't we leverage that
rev3-rBKV4rOgSJU-00008 and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
rev3-rFpDK2KhAgw-00001 they have social meaning
rev3-rFpDK2KhAgw-00002 they were unexpected pleasures
rev3-rFpDK2KhAgw-00003 sometimes it goes further
rev3-rFpDK2KhAgw-00006 or where does he live
rev3-rFpDK2KhAgw-00007 strangers might ask each other for a sip of water
rev3-rGfhahVBIQw-00001 and this leads to oddities
rev3-rGfhahVBIQw-00002 but this is the source of innovation
rev3-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00001 well why is that
rev3-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00002 now i will maintain
rev3-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00005 what difference does it make if they talk like jerry seinfeld
rev3-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00006 i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
rev3-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00007 well what difference does this make
rev3-rSSanSYZDT4-00001 and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive
rev3-rSSanSYZDT4-00002 what makes the heart unique
rev3-rZCxdbqMc2Q-00001 i will be back
rev3-rftagV38YKY-00001 i didn't know where i was
rev3-s0YjL9rZyR0-00003 this is not a put down of anyone
rev3-s0YjL9rZyR0-00004 it is wrong
rev3-s0YjL9rZyR0-00005 it is irresponsible
rev3-s0YjL9rZyR0-00007 are we brave enough to welcome it
rev3-s0YjL9rZyR0-00008 but it's different
rev3-s4smjT1qwZU-00002 there's no structure
rev3-sVtIuDKFO1c-00001 getting a college education is a 20 year investment
rev3-sVtIuDKFO1c-00003 when you grow up poor you want to be rich
rev3-shG0ezBeeJc-00001 how could i let them down
rev3-shG0ezBeeJc-00002 sometimes it's messy and it's always unpredictable
rev3-stngBN4hp14-00001 about a year after 9 11 researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world
rev3-sxnlvwprfSc-00001 i teach at stanford
rev3-sxnlvwprfSc-00002 i'm a physician practicing with cutting edge technology
rev3-sxnlvwprfSc-00003 we're losing a ritual
rev3-sxnlvwprfSc-00007 this is when i was in texas
rev3-sxnlvwprfSc-00008 they had her scanned inside out
rev3-sxnlvwprfSc-00011 i would listen to the heart
rev3-t2gbcVaZ448-00002 after all i was a bit unconventional
rev3-t2gbcVaZ448-00003 i've struggled to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them
rev3-t2gbcVaZ448-00004 what if i had told her my story years ago
rev3-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00001 so you want to go to that board meeting but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest
rev3-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00002 that robot put on a great show
rev3-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00004 we almost don't feel ourselves
rev3-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00005 so what do we do
rev3-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00006 we connect more and more
rev3-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00007 when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
rev3-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00008 and that's what i'm calling for here now
rev3-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00009 do the same thing at work
rev3-ta2Wvy9FSgA-00001 that's pretty cool
rev3-ta2Wvy9FSgA-00002 we have the plan
rev3-ta2Wvy9FSgA-00003 but if they don't stay in paris the international pressure will be overwhelming
rev3-tbSWdVA4Sbo-00001 we might say then well let's not worry about this
rev3-tgSCwQwYNjc-00001 women's day was coming up
rev3-tiSiSM3pk5M-00002 well let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
rev3-tiSiSM3pk5M-00003 what can i do about it
rev3-tiSiSM3pk5M-00005 it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it
rev3-tiSiSM3pk5M-00009 you've broken your back
rev3-tiSiSM3pk5M-00010 you'll never walk again
rev3-tiSiSM3pk5M-00012 it's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away
rev3-tzJYY2p0QIc-00001 growing up i was always intrigued by how people change
rev3-tzJYY2p0QIc-00003 that's not to say it's impossible
rev3-u4L130DkdOw-00001 and how is that possible
rev3-uJr4wGcLNsA-00001 she never wanted to tell me
rev3-uJr4wGcLNsA-00003 my parents came from germany
rev3-uJr4wGcLNsA-00005 some of them were really afraid of contagion and they wouldn't even walk in front of our
rev3-uJr4wGcLNsA-00007 so what was i going to do
rev3-uJr4wGcLNsA-00009 constance baker motley
rev3-uJr4wGcLNsA-00010 that is the right answer
rev3-uL5XUwfkxZw-00002 and work like a dog
rev3-uL5XUwfkxZw-00003 that's your grandfather
rev3-uL5XUwfkxZw-00004 tell me about that
rev3-uL5XUwfkxZw-00006 and that's all
rev3-uL5XUwfkxZw-00007 they were all white
rev3-uL5XUwfkxZw-00008 so they felt safe to come there
rev3-uL5XUwfkxZw-00011 we didn't understand the program
rev3-uL5XUwfkxZw-00013 i said we work together
rev3-uL5XUwfkxZw-00015 i may never go to your house you may never come to my house
rev3-uqS6T6TAu74-00001 i became a psychology researcher and i've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
rev3-uzKBGtf0i0M-00002 and it is important
rev3-uzKBGtf0i0M-00004 without it we literally can't interface with others
rev3-uzKBGtf0i0M-00005 my history wasn't right
rev3-uzKBGtf0i0M-00007 my desire to disappear was still very powerful
rev3-uzKBGtf0i0M-00008 i take it to therapy
rev3-vGX3FASrQq4-00001 thank you very much
rev3-vXPJVwwEmiM-00001 he's at a technology conference in florida
rev3-vXPJVwwEmiM-00004 you probably won't
rev3-vXPJVwwEmiM-00005 nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
rev3-vXPJVwwEmiM-00006 most independent media was shut down
rev3-vXPJVwwEmiM-00007 we have to fix the internet
rev3-vXPJVwwEmiM-00008 we have to fix our education
rev3-vhVWzkbAW4I-00002 it showed no blockages
rev3-vhVWzkbAW4I-00003 but linda was lucky
rev3-vhVWzkbAW4I-00004 she found us we found her disease
rev3-vhVWzkbAW4I-00005 but for too many women that's not the case
rev3-vhVWzkbAW4I-00007 the authors looked at papers written over a 10 year period and hundreds had to be thrown out
rev3-vhVWzkbAW4I-00008 we know that every cell has a sex
rev3-vhVWzkbAW4I-00011 we have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum
rev3-vhVWzkbAW4I-00012 and it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine
rev3-w1R4F9sSoow-00001 we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just iraq and afghanistan
rev3-w1R4F9sSoow-00003 we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own work
rev3-w1R4F9sSoow-00005 i do believe we can fix what's broken
rev3-w1R4F9sSoow-00006 we all want to
rev3-wG4RnDNWtJo-00001 that was a huge problem at the haiti earthquake
rev3-wG4RnDNWtJo-00003 we lost valuable data
rev3-wG4RnDNWtJo-00004 it's about the data
rev3-wGMLhaa98GI-00001 i can hardly wait
rev3-wKlMcLTqRLs-00001 why did my child develop autism
rev3-wlR1ojoiue0-00001 they were wonderful people
rev3-wlR1ojoiue0-00004 this is possible
rev3-wlR1ojoiue0-00005 the world's companies governments and non profits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this
rev3-wmMrZyVANUo-00001 and in many cases we don't
rev3-wmMrZyVANUo-00002 but we all should
rev3-wmMrZyVANUo-00003 this will pay dividends
rev3-wzkFoetpSSM-00002 i feel that god knows me
rev3-wzkFoetpSSM-00004 and i thought we should just stay home
rev3-wzkFoetpSSM-00005 the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
rev3-wzkFoetpSSM-00007 so we decided to go to the mosque
rev3-x4m6j7rSyzY-00001 i know it works
rev3-x95nwilkaio-00001 but i grew up in canada far from my arab roots
rev3-x95nwilkaio-00002 they have been sold by their families often to wealthy arab tourists
rev3-x95nwilkaio-00003 this is just one face of a booming sex trade across the arab region
rev3-x95nwilkaio-00005 social change doesn't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation
rev3-xFSCX9mAHPo-00001 we're not playing with each other
rev3-xFSCX9mAHPo-00002 there's a million different ways to eat pizza
rev3-xFSCX9mAHPo-00003 if we're still hungry we might have some more
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00004 all of you are members of tribes
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00007 you don't want this
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00008 this is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00009 and i want to make the point that as members of society we need to
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00012 if you want this experience to live on as something historic then at the reception
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00014 but we're not done yet
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00015 it comes out of a place called the gallup organization
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00016 you know they do polls right
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00019 pretty much everybody else who does polls
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00020 so i'd like to leave you with these thoughts
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00021 the group gels
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00023 but you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00024 there was no road map
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00025 in fact south africa has not gone down that road
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00027 life is great
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00031 what about martin luther king
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00034 and he grew up essentially in stage one
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00035 my life really sucks
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00036 i don't know anybody
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00038 but i don't
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00039 you're hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people a tribe about how
rev3-xTkKSJSqUSI-00040 and you don't leave them where they are
rev3-xkFTZcUPjBg-00001 i was going through a hard time as well
rev3-xkFTZcUPjBg-00002 i was like what
rev3-xkFTZcUPjBg-00003 what about you
rev3-xlUPlxSpDRo-00001 you don't have to bring any quarters because the washer and dryer are free
rev3-xukDIWFMU9Y-00002 look at this pretty structure
rev3-xukDIWFMU9Y-00003 has a coherent movement
rev3-y1KIVZw7Jxk-00003 that's not an improbable sample
rev3-y1KIVZw7Jxk-00004 you can navigate space
rev3-y1KIVZw7Jxk-00005 you know about numbers
rev3-y6MC4iXhT6I-00001 we're looking for something more
rev3-yMWlkJAqKYU-00001 how is that possible
rev3-yNhu0MGS2MA-00001 why not just let businesses compete
rev3-yeVz0rtXCmw-00001 i started to walk in the community and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't
rev3-yeVz0rtXCmw-00004 we had law enforcement partners
rev3-yeVz0rtXCmw-00005 they need support
rev3-zL2FOrx41N0-00001 how does it happen
rev3-zMGE3mbS9NY-00001 at the same time
rev3-zuYzOn0U2PY-00001 it's a fucking orgy
rev3-zuYzOn0U2PY-00002 how is it made
rev3-zuYzOn0U2PY-00003 why was it made
rev3-zuYzOn0U2PY-00005 they feel at home
rev4-0Fi83BHQsMA-00002 we really don't walk anymore
rev4-0Fi83BHQsMA-00004 at some point i'm going to get out
rev4-0Fi83BHQsMA-00005 when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
rev4-0Fi83BHQsMA-00006 we'd love to help
rev4-0QVXdEOiCw8-00001 i wasn't very good at reading things
rev4-0VJqrlH9cdI-00001 and he said on the spot absolutely yes
rev4-0VJqrlH9cdI-00002 he was smiling and we said go
rev4-0ZfSOArXbGQ-00001 we said yes
rev4-0ZfSOArXbGQ-00002 we were so excited
rev4-0ZfSOArXbGQ-00003 and so one of the major challenges of our project really is to find photographs that were taken before something
rev4-0gks6ceq4eQ-00002 not what is it
rev4-0gks6ceq4eQ-00005 predictions are the basis of every experience that you have
rev4-0gks6ceq4eQ-00006 they are the basis of every action that you take
rev4-0gks6ceq4eQ-00007 it's using past experience based on similar situations to try to make meaning
rev4-0gks6ceq4eQ-00008 and so how does your brain give you that detail
rev4-0gks6ceq4eQ-00009 well that's what predictions are
rev4-0gks6ceq4eQ-00010 i'm totally serious
rev4-0gks6ceq4eQ-00013 i know i have
rev4-0gks6ceq4eQ-00015 so when you're born you can make feelings like calmness and
rev4-0iIh5YYDR2o-00001 i'm not a social problem guy
rev4-18uDutylDa4-00001 i feel guilty sometimes
rev4-18uDutylDa4-00002 so i'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone
rev4-18uDutylDa4-00004 boy it matters a lot
rev4-18uDutylDa4-00007 what do you mean
rev4-18uDutylDa4-00009 your job needs to be challenging
rev4-18uDutylDa4-00010 he's a great guy
rev4-18uDutylDa4-00011 you want to work for him
rev4-1K5SycZjGhI-00001 blocks have names
rev4-1L6lSFiV4xo-00002 you just have to find another term and look that up
rev4-1L6lSFiV4xo-00003 i do like magic
rev4-1PNX6MSdVsk-00001 i don't have an overview
rev4-1PNX6MSdVsk-00005 more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
rev4-1PNX6MSdVsk-00007 trust is the response
rev4-1PNX6MSdVsk-00009 we can do it two people together trying to improve trust
rev4-1PNX6MSdVsk-00010 because it's given by other people
rev4-1PNX6MSdVsk-00011 let me give you a simple commercial example
rev4-1US4jjWtua8-00001 we're going to eat these cows
rev4-1US4jjWtua8-00002 they're not being shipped up here
rev4-1US4jjWtua8-00004 it's not optional
rev4-1US4jjWtua8-00005 it's not a luxury
rev4-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00001 we've done the research
rev4-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00004 she had to impersonate a man
rev4-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00005 mortality is not going down it's going up
rev4-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00006 and not enough is being done about this
rev4-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00007 it told us about hormone replacement therapy
rev4-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00011 women are worth it
rev4-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00013 so what do you think happens to these gals
rev4-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00014 they're often not recognized sent home
rev4-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00015 i'm not sure what it was
rev4-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00017 well once again women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem
rev4-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00020 and we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years
rev4-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00021 and in fact it probably won't
rev4-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00022 so we have these feast and famine cycles
rev4-1bnzVjOJ6NM-00023 so thank you for your attention
rev4-27lMmdmySb8-00001 everybody focuses on the things that kill us and that's what i was focusing on
rev4-27lMmdmySb8-00002 and they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants
rev4-27lMmdmySb8-00005 actually studied hormones
rev4-27lMmdmySb8-00006 we can't see it most of the time
rev4-27lMmdmySb8-00008 and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases
rev4-2SlBiFZ85d0-00002 i have three sons so i see how they fight
rev4-2SlBiFZ85d0-00003 we're not just part of the same species
rev4-2SlBiFZ85d0-00004 we're part of the same family
rev4-2SlBiFZ85d0-00006 and i won't name names but you know who you are
rev4-2SlBiFZ85d0-00008 so that's what i'm doing
rev4-2UStOghblfE-00001 why are we embedded in social networks
rev4-2UStOghblfE-00002 i mean how do they form
rev4-2UStOghblfE-00003 how do they operate
rev4-2UStOghblfE-00004 how far do they reach
rev4-2UStOghblfE-00005 and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother
rev4-3A1LvXRnpVg-00001 give me input
rev4-3OgsRa7VDtI-00001 they can't get what they need when they need it
rev4-3OgsRa7VDtI-00003 that's the status quo today
rev4-3OgsRa7VDtI-00004 gov just six people
rev4-3OgsRa7VDtI-00008 yes it's hard
rev4-3nSEitPb7BU-00001 but it wasn't just individuals
rev4-3r1IPsldbBg-00002 well there's a self fulfilling prophecy
rev4-3r1IPsldbBg-00003 we shouldn't be nationalistic
rev4-3uSQlcGCHUU-00001 this economy won't work and thomas jefferson saying the people won't trust that
rev4-3uSQlcGCHUU-00006 but that system has tons of problems
rev4-3uSQlcGCHUU-00008 wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive
rev4-3uSQlcGCHUU-00011 but that is not the case at all
rev4-3uSQlcGCHUU-00012 or do you think the government should redistribute
rev4-3uSQlcGCHUU-00014 and nothing happened at all
rev4-3uSQlcGCHUU-00015 so i'm in the media
rev4-3uSQlcGCHUU-00016 they don't represent what our views are
rev4-3uSQlcGCHUU-00017 we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton
rev4-3vfuCPFb8wk-00001 but it's more complicated
rev4-3zqZPujAPuc-00001 so no more missing guys
rev4-48xS00Iy0ac-00002 buildings can be like people
rev4-48xS00Iy0ac-00003 their faces broadcast their experience
rev4-4AYE3w5TWHs-00004 and then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues
rev4-4AYE3w5TWHs-00005 so just like with a bike we don't talk about it
rev4-4AYE3w5TWHs-00006 you can try it
rev4-4ErEBkjS3PY-00001 i'm a professor and we're passionate about education
rev4-4Q2aznfmcYU-00001 now don't get me wrong
rev4-4Q2aznfmcYU-00002 of course they would
rev4-4n8qT0vQbWk-00001 but this is what i heard from a lot of outraged people
rev4-4n8qT0vQbWk-00003 we have to decide what it means
rev4-4v4XxlfVk3o-00001 this is completely bizarre
rev4-55yGmKc6WfE-00001 they're looking and looking and finding love
rev4-5Knz100ldLM-00001 we can open up city hall
rev4-5P04stEjJ9E-00003 i'm not a military brat
rev4-5P04stEjJ9E-00004 they signed up because they wanted some form of revenge
rev4-5P04stEjJ9E-00005 one was to be a soldier
rev4-5P04stEjJ9E-00006 the other was to be a baseball player
rev4-5Yj3nGv0kn8-00001 are you losing your mind
rev4-5Yj3nGv0kn8-00002 so let's watch what happens
rev4-5b5BDoddOLA-00001 so that was easy
rev4-5b5BDoddOLA-00002 we weren't considered the real thing
rev4-5b5BDoddOLA-00004 and the way to do it is through the bloodstream
rev4-5ifMRNag2XU-00001 i want to be the center of attention
rev4-5riPKdpuoiI-00002 did you find the gold
rev4-62cNtvx6P8E-00001 i could make that decision
rev4-66koScWSHBU-00001 and the problem that we're solving is what are those things
rev4-66koScWSHBU-00003 they won the game
rev4-66koScWSHBU-00005 so bear with me
rev4-66koScWSHBU-00006 thank you very much
rev4-6OaIdwUdSxE-00003 make me laugh
rev4-6Waurx8eS1o-00001 how can somebody like that make you feel smart
rev4-6Waurx8eS1o-00003 he made me feel smart
rev4-6Waurx8eS1o-00008 you saw him act
rev4-6kHSuYwt0qs-00002 we don't use audio we don't use video
rev4-6ra1MIKlYB0-00002 how are you
rev4-6wNif5SlN08-00001 the boys reminded me of home
rev4-6wNif5SlN08-00005 i didn't want to
rev4-6wNif5SlN08-00007 i said in arabic
rev4-6wNif5SlN08-00010 after college i desperately needed to find a place to call home
rev4-6wNif5SlN08-00011 1 percent who get to do that
rev4-6wNif5SlN08-00012 they had hit the jackpot
rev4-6wNif5SlN08-00013 life is good
rev4-6wNif5SlN08-00014 it wasn't like them to miss practice
rev4-7OMLSs8t1ng-00001 i do understand it
rev4-7OMLSs8t1ng-00002 doesn't happen very much
rev4-7OMLSs8t1ng-00007 i don't know
rev4-7OMLSs8t1ng-00010 you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases
rev4-7OMLSs8t1ng-00012 what about polio
rev4-7OMLSs8t1ng-00013 let's have that
rev4-7OMLSs8t1ng-00014 no one's ever said that before
rev4-7OMLSs8t1ng-00017 we don't trust the man
rev4-7OMLSs8t1ng-00018 it has to stop
rev4-7OMLSs8t1ng-00019 it's a debate about words about metaphors
rev4-7ZymFMmpOa0-00002 but in fact they found something very surprising
rev4-7ZymFMmpOa0-00005 we used to have a manufacturing economy which was about building goods and products and now we have a service
rev4-7ZymFMmpOa0-00006 but that really isn't true anymore
rev4-7ZymFMmpOa0-00007 you would be issuing orders from above
rev4-7ZymFMmpOa0-00009 this is a real mystery
rev4-7ZymFMmpOa0-00011 and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
rev4-7gXq1ml6B1E-00001 it's natural connective tissue
rev4-7gkdzkVbuVA-00001 originally the sample was aged 18 to 94
rev4-7gkdzkVbuVA-00003 how sad are you right now
rev4-7gkdzkVbuVA-00004 how frustrated are you right now
rev4-7gkdzkVbuVA-00005 we take less notice of trivial matters
rev4-7hQ0rgVfsP8-00001 well i was surprised
rev4-7hQ0rgVfsP8-00002 i did not know this
rev4-7kkRkhAXZGg-00003 now in all seriousness movies are actually really important
rev4-7kkRkhAXZGg-00004 storytelling is so important
rev4-7kkRkhAXZGg-00006 stories are amazing
rev4-7kkRkhAXZGg-00007 but what does
rev4-7kkRkhAXZGg-00010 what would happen
rev4-7nZqiPLCvM4-00001 you don't do much editing
rev4-7qT3RpaBlJo-00001 it is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least
rev4-7qT3RpaBlJo-00002 one you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is
rev4-7uN4I1wEOXE-00001 i have to take a year off
rev4-81Ub0SMxZQo-00001 i'm talking about teachers
rev4-81Ub0SMxZQo-00002 how would i know what i was doing differently
rev4-81Ub0SMxZQo-00003 so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
rev4-87AEeLpodnE-00001 they supported me all the way through it
rev4-87AEeLpodnE-00002 something was wrong
rev4-87AEeLpodnE-00004 has it gotten better
rev4-87AEeLpodnE-00005 that's something we ought to celebrate
rev4-87AEeLpodnE-00008 irreconcilable differences right
rev4-87AEeLpodnE-00010 we're blessed with people who listen to us
rev4-8GQZuzIdeQQ-00001 it wasn't who i was
rev4-8GQZuzIdeQQ-00004 here's where i stand
rev4-8HfoKd873HY-00001 i tried everything
rev4-8K9Gg164Bsw-00001 what a contradiction
rev4-8UhqkX2VAmo-00001 otherwise millions more will die
rev4-8VwTZFYSfvw-00001 i don't even know if it's a real job title to be honest
rev4-8VwTZFYSfvw-00002 it was the coldest i've ever been
rev4-8Z24LCysq3A-00001 one thousand eight hundred and thirty six people died
rev4-8iSpNVj5KMw-00001 he got part time i
rev4-8iSpNVj5KMw-00002 i forgive you and i do not hate you
rev4-8mPpe8AL21A-00001 because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group
rev4-8nbeD1mwCdo-00001 does the water stay there forever
rev4-8nt3edWLgIg-00001 we don't need moore's law to continue
rev4-8nt3edWLgIg-00003 we just need to keep going
rev4-8nt3edWLgIg-00004 we have problems that we desperately need to solve
rev4-8nt3edWLgIg-00005 i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of artificial intelligence
rev4-8vNIrPeRGlM-00001 it cracked open my world
rev4-8vNIrPeRGlM-00003 so they won't go for a walk they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat
rev4-8vNIrPeRGlM-00005 she would hide in the closet
rev4-8vNIrPeRGlM-00009 they want to know how often your dog gets outside
rev4-8vNIrPeRGlM-00010 they want to know how much exercise your dog is getting
rev4-8vNIrPeRGlM-00011 his name is lonnie hodge and he's a veteran of vietnam
rev4-95ovIJ3dsNk-00002 for hepatitis it was also two and a half times
rev4-95ovIJ3dsNk-00003 for depression it was four and a half times
rev4-95ovIJ3dsNk-00005 what kind of trauma am i talking about here
rev4-95ovIJ3dsNk-00006 children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
rev4-95ovIJ3dsNk-00009 well imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear
rev4-9B0PaSznWJE-00002 so thank you very much
rev4-9CqVYUOjHLw-00002 it's the war on terror
rev4-9JKy6ZfmBn0-00001 you don't get a chance to mess it up
rev4-9JKy6ZfmBn0-00002 one of them got caught up in the water
rev4-9RMx31GnNXY-00001 plus we have stem cells
rev4-9RMx31GnNXY-00002 i was able to do more things
rev4-9RMx31GnNXY-00003 i know i was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery
rev4-9RMx31GnNXY-00004 and when i was 10 i didn't realize how amazing it was
rev4-9TPFLHvn024-00002 there were no back doors
rev4-9YekkGz1E2k-00001 i had to do something
rev4-9YekkGz1E2k-00002 this fishing village was famous for sculpture
rev4-9kBKQS7J7xI-00001 i don't paint
rev4-9kBKQS7J7xI-00002 this is going to become really freaking obvious
rev4-9uOMectkCCs-00001 dan replies so often you won't even notice it
rev4-9uOMectkCCs-00002 and then something falls off the wall
rev4-9uOMectkCCs-00004 we all know what he's talking about
rev4-9uOMectkCCs-00005 that wasn't the case for me
rev4-9uOMectkCCs-00007 no more charge before use
rev4-AMVgX8cXsHA-00002 and that's bad
rev4-AO4In7d6XSc-00001 what about manipulation
rev4-AO4In7d6XSc-00002 so that's mobile manipulation
rev4-AO4In7d6XSc-00003 i love building robots
rev4-AWPrOvzzqZk-00002 and when you think about it it makes a lot of sense because forming a question is a really complex
rev4-AegIbt2j0sU-00001 and they also knew that they can tap into a workforce
rev4-AsSd2nmoKNA-00001 i tagged along with my neighbors
rev4-AsSd2nmoKNA-00002 and i said to myself i wanna get me one of them
rev4-AsSd2nmoKNA-00003 who wrote that
rev4-AsSd2nmoKNA-00004 i'll meet you there
rev4-B8rmi95pYL0-00002 the key here really is knowledge
rev4-BHY0FxzoKZE-00002 i tried everything
rev4-BHY0FxzoKZE-00003 maybe i did an experiment on myself without even knowing it
rev4-BImnT7lcLDE-00001 you just had to do things sometimes
rev4-BImnT7lcLDE-00002 and boy they were like what
rev4-BImnT7lcLDE-00003 how do you get to build those relationships
rev4-BImnT7lcLDE-00004 so we created a new school
rev4-BImnT7lcLDE-00006 but that doesn't mean that we can't
rev4-BQZKs75RMqM-00001 it's almost becoming the syntax of a new language
rev4-BhMKmovNjvc-00001 on the other hand statistics that's a subject that you could and should use
rev4-Bo8YN3oB0Cw-00002 this is what i'm supposed to naturally be able to do
rev4-Bo8YN3oB0Cw-00003 why is it not working
rev4-Bs86giWcjLA-00001 and you know what
rev4-Bs86giWcjLA-00002 they were right
rev4-Bs86giWcjLA-00004 it brings people together and it supports creativity and social cohesion
rev4-BvpmZktlBFs-00002 did you hear he has gone mad
rev4-BzeTjn0R2VY-00001 i mean everyone did
rev4-BzeTjn0R2VY-00003 again it will not happen overnight
rev4-BzeTjn0R2VY-00004 it needs to happen
rev4-CDsNZJTWw0w-00001 i have resources
rev4-CdZJ0SMbh10-00001 and is this really the solution
rev4-CgNx9Bgac1I-00002 so i went to my doctor
rev4-CgNx9Bgac1I-00003 but i'm not happy
rev4-ClfBxWPkBKU-00001 in other words a coroner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe
rev4-ClfBxWPkBKU-00003 and remember we had experience with this
rev4-ClfBxWPkBKU-00005 roughly 300 savings and loans involved roughly 600 senior officials
rev4-ClfBxWPkBKU-00008 that is not simply critical to our economy
rev4-ClfBxWPkBKU-00009 thank you very much
rev4-ClfBxWPkBKU-00010 what do we need to do
rev4-ClfBxWPkBKU-00011 what can we do in all of this
rev4-CxEqV8WtfOo-00001 i'm 27 years old
rev4-D8SSLLnV3W8-00001 that's more expensive
rev4-DCIL2nvU4x8-00001 and when we do the results will often surprise
rev4-DDaldVHUedI-00002 i wanted to stay in this relationship
rev4-DDaldVHUedI-00003 things were going well
rev4-DDaldVHUedI-00004 this is a really important chapter to me
rev4-DDaldVHUedI-00005 why are we skipping over this
rev4-DDaldVHUedI-00006 i went to the dean
rev4-DOgsYATbVSs-00001 but here's the thing
rev4-DOgsYATbVSs-00003 it's not like teaching them how to ride a bike
rev4-DOgsYATbVSs-00004 i don't know
rev4-DjeIpjhAqsM-00002 and that led me to this project
rev4-DjeIpjhAqsM-00003 we have to turn that around
rev4-DsrxbqFo41k-00002 so i went to church as often as i could
rev4-E0oPnS7rUwE-00001 it's a performance venue
rev4-E0oPnS7rUwE-00002 but it's not enough
rev4-E0oPnS7rUwE-00003 and they're not just focused on money
rev4-E0oPnS7rUwE-00006 i've built a career
rev4-E0oPnS7rUwE-00007 we are magic
rev4-E22icGCvGXk-00001 they're completely flat and they're basically cardboard characters
rev4-E22icGCvGXk-00004 i got about 3000 emails
rev4-E22icGCvGXk-00006 my own website
rev4-EGjxIS5MPUY-00001 it's always what it was and what it can be
rev4-EV3OmxrowWE-00001 they're not my children
rev4-EV3OmxrowWE-00003 and when we're unprepared we overreact
rev4-EV3OmxrowWE-00004 and i did not know what to say
rev4-EV3OmxrowWE-00007 we can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate locate
rev4-F3OhcpKSUBc-00001 and looking at that pattern
rev4-F3OhcpKSUBc-00004 he saw it written down somewhere
rev4-F3OhcpKSUBc-00006 and now we want to do a double double of the age wave coming through
rev4-F3OhcpKSUBc-00007 that's sort of the state of the art
rev4-F5h6ynoq8uM-00001 what's this guy talking about
rev4-F5h6ynoq8uM-00002 let me illustrate this
rev4-FD6CqD1kV8s-00001 and he's a bad guy
rev4-FD6CqD1kV8s-00003 there were others like myself who were full time
rev4-FD6CqD1kV8s-00004 it's not a dirty word
rev4-FD6CqD1kV8s-00005 the children were killed on the spot
rev4-FFG2rilqT2g-00003 well you get several things
rev4-FFG2rilqT2g-00004 the gas that they used at first in many cases was oxygen
rev4-FFG2rilqT2g-00005 so they added oxygen to methane gas
rev4-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00001 so what is an idea drawing
rev4-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00002 here i'm one person talking to you
rev4-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00003 you're all collective
rev4-FKxaL8Iau8Q-00007 and if it's completely okay what's the joke
rev4-FQEEMpzPZlY-00001 they change from person to person
rev4-FcmSmAwPkxg-00001 we've all done this
rev4-FcmSmAwPkxg-00005 when it's 10 degrees below zero
rev4-FcmSmAwPkxg-00006 there's love and there's friendship and there's protection
rev4-FcmSmAwPkxg-00007 you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive doses of chemotherapy
rev4-FcmSmAwPkxg-00008 we see it as a disruption of real life and important work
rev4-FcmSmAwPkxg-00010 she suffered so much
rev4-FcmSmAwPkxg-00012 could we merge
rev4-Fivy99RtMfM-00002 that's awful right
rev4-FmpIMt95ndU-00001 sort of leadership by humiliation
rev4-FmpIMt95ndU-00004 thanks for asking
rev4-FmpIMt95ndU-00005 i said where is he now
rev4-FqrLUtIFVjs-00001 so how does this work
rev4-FqrLUtIFVjs-00002 we change the economics for the bad guys
rev4-FxtSMZKMdes-00002 we have the right to respect
rev4-FxtSMZKMdes-00004 i'm a feminist but i'm a rather bad one
rev4-FxtSMZKMdes-00005 i am full of contradictions
rev4-FxtSMZKMdes-00006 i want no part of any of that
rev4-FxtSMZKMdes-00007 i enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things
rev4-FxtSMZKMdes-00009 we go far beyond reasonable constructive criticism to dissecting any given woman's feminism
rev4-FxtSMZKMdes-00010 they are gorgeous and headstrong brilliant girls who are a whole lot of brave
rev4-FxtSMZKMdes-00014 some boys broke me when i was so young i did not know what boys can do to break a girl
rev4-FxtSMZKMdes-00015 i learned to write like them and then i learned to write as myself
rev4-FxtSMZKMdes-00017 i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such bravery
rev4-G2XBIkHW954-00002 we're seeing the baby brain
rev4-GAMR5RDSLJo-00005 lots of money
rev4-GAMR5RDSLJo-00006 supporting local economies
rev4-GAMR5RDSLJo-00007 it's a top predator
rev4-GAMR5RDSLJo-00009 i love red wine
rev4-GAMR5RDSLJo-00010 i'm going to be so healthy
rev4-GAMR5RDSLJo-00011 i want to know how i impact them
rev4-GAMR5RDSLJo-00014 i want to know how they impact me
rev4-GAMR5RDSLJo-00016 so let's start there
rev4-GAMR5RDSLJo-00018 i made more money
rev4-GAMR5RDSLJo-00019 this is great
rev4-GAMR5RDSLJo-00020 we've seen an image of our blue planet our world bank
rev4-GGScU5ESei4-00001 but there's actually more to the story than that
rev4-GGScU5ESei4-00004 what's different is how the molecules are put together
rev4-GGScU5ESei4-00005 the oil will never run out
rev4-GIbz9ms9Z9k-00001 you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might go wrong
rev4-GIbz9ms9Z9k-00003 they want a treatment
rev4-GIbz9ms9Z9k-00004 we are all responsible
rev4-GMynksvCcUI-00001 my father worked at this factory he said
rev4-GMynksvCcUI-00002 my grandfather worked at this factory
rev4-GMynksvCcUI-00008 why not ask all of the states to do that instead
rev4-GMynksvCcUI-00009 and imagine what might happen because every region has something to offer
rev4-GSf6nijSSdA-00002 i've tried engaging people
rev4-GSf6nijSSdA-00003 and he surprised me by saying you know what
rev4-GSf6nijSSdA-00004 patriarchy is not boys and men
rev4-GSf6nijSSdA-00005 that allowed me to take a stand for myself
rev4-GSf6nijSSdA-00007 i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse including three
rev4-GSf6nijSSdA-00010 and guess what silicon valley
rev4-GSf6nijSSdA-00011 so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
rev4-GZadCj8O1S0-00001 so that's it for now
rev4-Gmai4zkKNcM-00001 it came from the way in which beijing has grown as a city
rev4-Gmai4zkKNcM-00002 that's really important
rev4-Gmai4zkKNcM-00003 and we couldn't just turn it off
rev4-Gmai4zkKNcM-00004 you're in there
rev4-Gmai4zkKNcM-00006 but the second of the transformations the climate transformations we have to decide to do
rev4-Gmai4zkKNcM-00007 we can see how to do that
rev4-GqnJFm1CS3c-00002 don't get me wrong it's not like we don't have comedy in the middle east
rev4-GvGAIGbnX7E-00001 they have to be able to teach us something as well
rev4-GvGAIGbnX7E-00004 and in that i need a surgery lexicon
rev4-H14bBuluwB8-00001 my research team and i went to west point military academy
rev4-H14bBuluwB8-00002 that's the work that stands before us
rev4-H9ZOpQzjukY-00001 we're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
rev4-HD4bpztESWw-00001 we're on the grid
rev4-HI7zfpitZpo-00002 who or what inspires you and why
rev4-HSercnrqeN4-00001 i exist because i have my women friends
rev4-HSercnrqeN4-00002 i don't know about you
rev4-HSercnrqeN4-00004 and guess what
rev4-HUM2rCIUdeI-00001 i looked at slaves
rev4-HUM2rCIUdeI-00003 there's no need to play the market
rev4-HUM2rCIUdeI-00004 it's not a lot of money at the global level
rev4-HbUeAdVXOVc-00001 this is the only part that's battery backed up
rev4-HdwOlk6HIVc-00001 and germany and france
rev4-HdwOlk6HIVc-00002 4 times the mass of the sun
rev4-HdwOlk6HIVc-00004 surely we know enough
rev4-HiwJ0hNl1Fw-00002 the same tool that united us to topple dictators
rev4-HiwJ0hNl1Fw-00003 i was terrified
rev4-Hj9oB4zpHww-00001 what is worth dying for
rev4-Hj9oB4zpHww-00003 that is what it is to have a domain of expertise
rev4-HqekWfSJCSA-00002 we can change our minds
rev4-Ht2fzax9wV0-00001 you need to be able to do something with it
rev4-Ht2fzax9wV0-00002 we're always trying to make it faster
rev4-IPBCxlxSSVk-00001 we will not be there
rev4-IS4IK8CiLg8-00001 what is that
rev4-IS4IK8CiLg8-00002 she contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work
rev4-IThAD5yKrgE-00001 it's not exactly rocket science
rev4-IWdzrZdRa38-00001 it's changed the way we talk
rev4-IWdzrZdRa38-00004 the board of ed
rev4-IWdzrZdRa38-00005 had no idea
rev4-IWdzrZdRa38-00006 they don't trust the law
rev4-IWdzrZdRa38-00007 why don't they trust the law
rev4-IWdzrZdRa38-00012 it's not true
rev4-IjbTiRbeNpM-00001 that was the only way to get anything done
rev4-IjbTiRbeNpM-00002 that's available right now
rev4-IjbTiRbeNpM-00003 art is not efficient
rev4-IjbTiRbeNpM-00004 human relationships are not efficient
rev4-IjbTiRbeNpM-00005 efficiency is for robots
rev4-Ip2SQa50uBI-00001 china is the world's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades
rev4-Ip2SQa50uBI-00003 how else can we create new ideas
rev4-Ip2SQa50uBI-00005 but some of our grandchildren probably will
rev4-J8FyHI00ELY-00001 that's what happened with my dad
rev4-J8FyHI00ELY-00002 my dad has alzheimer's disease
rev4-J8FyHI00ELY-00004 they get scared to walk around
rev4-J8FyHI00ELY-00005 they get scared to move
rev4-J8FyHI00ELY-00006 i'm trying to become a better person
rev4-J8FyHI00ELY-00008 even when it's so hard
rev4-J8FyHI00ELY-00009 and what i need now is to learn to be like that
rev4-JFQLvbVJVMg-00001 so this is obvious right
rev4-JFQLvbVJVMg-00003 so what's women's experience as it relates to mentoring
rev4-JHk9YVjhk7c-00001 is it that i write very well
rev4-JISHzvXk5bk-00001 quite the opposite
rev4-JP0w9lZoLwU-00002 thank you very much
rev4-JSSc7hYKstI-00005 especially when it comes to climate change
rev4-JSSc7hYKstI-00006 so i want to talk to you today about what i think is a much more complete recipe for deep
rev4-JSSc7hYKstI-00007 this meant that the movements demanding change knew what they were against crushing poverty widening
rev4-JSSc7hYKstI-00008 progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
rev4-JSSc7hYKstI-00010 well very often we think about political change in defined compartments these days
rev4-JSSc7hYKstI-00014 what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what its core values are
rev4-JSSc7hYKstI-00015 a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish
rev4-JSSc7hYKstI-00016 so we locked ourselves in a room for two days and we tried to figure out what bound us together
rev4-JSSc7hYKstI-00017 well we rejected all of that
rev4-JSSc7hYKstI-00019 but in the process they also train our brains to tune out when somebody else's issue
rev4-JTN9Nx8VYtk-00002 i don't have an answer
rev4-Jc9RdbHEFa0-00001 i don't know
rev4-JcJ3MfJNm6g-00001 the science is there
rev4-Jm2dWbNsnZI-00001 let's think about your ethical footprint
rev4-Jm2dWbNsnZI-00002 but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
rev4-KNSRifMSSvM-00001 and he wanted one so badly
rev4-KPNn880KWfU-00003 which brings me to my second point
rev4-KPNn880KWfU-00005 i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
rev4-KuWXfjyGhk0-00001 a huge opportunity unleashing of new potential for innovation for development
rev4-KuWXfjyGhk0-00004 there will be invisible capacity
rev4-KuWXfjyGhk0-00005 but the question is who will have it
rev4-KuWXfjyGhk0-00007 of course migration will become even more important
rev4-KuWXfjyGhk0-00009 and this change is getting more rapid
rev4-KvvjDOtS2sw-00005 i didn't always succeed
rev4-KvvjDOtS2sw-00006 i hadn't bathed in three days
rev4-KvvjDOtS2sw-00007 why are you really here
rev4-KvvjDOtS2sw-00010 and i cried
rev4-KvvjDOtS2sw-00012 i was winning awards
rev4-KvvjDOtS2sw-00013 i was living in my own apartment
rev4-KvvjDOtS2sw-00014 i was no longer homeless
rev4-KxLMjn4WPBY-00001 race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences
rev4-KxLMjn4WPBY-00002 i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to
rev4-LEx6K4P4GJc-00001 i know platforms i know computers they put me on the internet when i was young
rev4-LEx6K4P4GJc-00003 what would that change about how we live
rev4-LEx6K4P4GJc-00004 what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
rev4-LEx6K4P4GJc-00005 a digital world farm
rev4-LEx6K4P4GJc-00010 why didn't you just tell me that
rev4-LHHlPnfOtRo-00001 well that's exciting
rev4-LIckScLypGA-00001 and dance has progressed
rev4-LIckScLypGA-00002 and this is happening every day
rev4-LIy2oVJtJsA-00002 they're not donated
rev4-LIy2oVJtJsA-00003 they're not heavily subsidized
rev4-LIy2oVJtJsA-00006 and use is what creates impact
rev4-LYCKzpXEW6E-00001 how could i come from a nation
rev4-LYCKzpXEW6E-00002 what kind of rituals are these
rev4-LYCKzpXEW6E-00003 the rituals were familiar
rev4-Li4S1yyrsTI-00001 why do i believe this
rev4-Li4S1yyrsTI-00003 and you know what else we did
rev4-Li4S1yyrsTI-00007 and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
rev4-Li4S1yyrsTI-00009 and so knowing that we went to the advertising council and we asked them to help us
rev4-Li4S1yyrsTI-00010 we were making what was invisible visible
rev4-Li4S1yyrsTI-00011 take a look at one of our spots
rev4-Li4S1yyrsTI-00013 and let me just put this in context
rev4-Li4S1yyrsTI-00014 we were obviously making a difference
rev4-Li4S1yyrsTI-00015 but we were still missing a critical element
rev4-Li4S1yyrsTI-00016 and that's what we did
rev4-Li4S1yyrsTI-00021 we met men where they were at and we built a program
rev4-Li4S1yyrsTI-00022 and he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving
rev4-LiUClSItcy0-00001 texting has a 100 percent open rate
rev4-LiUClSItcy0-00004 i think it might be a lifeline
rev4-LiUClSItcy0-00005 he told me not to tell anyone
rev4-LiUClSItcy0-00006 it's my dad
rev4-LiUClSItcy0-00007 that last one's an actual text message that we received
rev4-LiUClSItcy0-00008 i will not forget the day we got that text message
rev4-LiUClSItcy0-00009 and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline
rev4-LjAsM1vAhW0-00001 the nazis invaded the netherlands
rev4-LpROaNue9GM-00001 but when i was little i remember he would kill flies in our house with my bb gun
rev4-LujWrkYsl64-00002 it was like a star trek episode you know
rev4-M0SbSz5Le10-00002 i started off in uganda
rev4-M5PiTCwoQRo-00001 well not so fast
rev4-M6TMSQWI9m4-00001 i'm in tucson
rev4-M7KSnq0xkWY-00001 we have to throw it away
rev4-MIAS1xQc7x8-00002 we can do it again
rev4-MNuOmTQdFjA-00001 and i don't have to do anything
rev4-MNuOmTQdFjA-00002 so i looked for furniture
rev4-MsLuQM5V3FA-00001 my other great passion is the environment
rev4-MsLuQM5V3FA-00002 i was considered a radical
rev4-MsLuQM5V3FA-00005 so let's get started now
rev4-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00003 go i said again sweat forming on my brow
rev4-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00006 i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
rev4-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00007 science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writing
rev4-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00009 it was faulty and most of the time i had to restart it over and over before it worked
rev4-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00011 for africans homegrown science fiction can be a will to power
rev4-Mt0PiXLvYlU-00012 it is in the water
rev4-MvXZzKZ3JYQ-00001 my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach terminal cancer
rev4-NA7krbsdXFA-00002 we suspended our values
rev4-NA7krbsdXFA-00003 and what was the result of that
rev4-NA7krbsdXFA-00005 but it's not just china
rev4-NA7krbsdXFA-00010 where are the philosophers
rev4-NA7krbsdXFA-00011 and that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you
rev4-NCJTV5KaJJc-00001 last week alone i got 238 pieces of nasty email and more
rev4-NCJTV5KaJJc-00002 but i'm a big fan of you as a person
rev4-NL0uxDscjdo-00001 and so they took them to some safe place
rev4-NL0uxDscjdo-00004 and in fact what did happen to my brain
rev4-NL0uxDscjdo-00005 i understand how this could happen
rev4-NYKcOFQCeno-00001 and that might have been the case
rev4-NYKcOFQCeno-00003 and that leads to a very powerful tool
rev4-NoCOagL69Ss-00001 to me it's not that clear
rev4-NoCOagL69Ss-00002 that may not always be the case
rev4-NqOjj1FCcVY-00001 imagine if we had across the country right now in local places but
rev4-NqOjj1FCcVY-00003 let me tell you about a couple of them
rev4-NqOjj1FCcVY-00004 it's just a wall
rev4-NqOjj1FCcVY-00005 i have passion in my heart
rev4-NqOjj1FCcVY-00006 i can stand up and do something
rev4-NqOjj1FCcVY-00007 both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
rev4-O0JDDyqtSVY-00001 but you know what
rev4-O0JDDyqtSVY-00002 but you know what
rev4-O3a9AYu5SUQ-00001 and that's pretty amazing
rev4-O6Vayv9FCLM-00001 that option is actually not on the table
rev4-O6Vayv9FCLM-00002 so it's up to us
rev4-ODLgS00f9BE-00002 we could only think of one way
rev4-OIlSXRCSBSI-00001 i even read many self help books
rev4-OIlSXRCSBSI-00002 the first lesson is about humility
rev4-OIlSXRCSBSI-00006 try it and let me know how it works for you
rev4-OIlSXRCSBSI-00007 i would love to hear from you
rev4-OM6XIICmSqo-00001 who's at the event
rev4-OM6XIICmSqo-00002 whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that
rev4-OM6XIICmSqo-00005 i can use it in my company
rev4-ONM4JupBzSE-00001 it's right there for you to find
rev4-ONM4JupBzSE-00003 there's nothing underground about it
rev4-ONM4JupBzSE-00005 we only sell you airtime
rev4-ORthzIOEf30-00001 it was appalling
rev4-OYfoGTIG7pY-00001 pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you
rev4-OYfoGTIG7pY-00002 i remember what you said to me
rev4-OYfoGTIG7pY-00003 i am thinking of your love for me
rev4-OYfoGTIG7pY-00004 i am torn by your love for me
rev4-OYfoGTIG7pY-00007 remember what i said my love
rev4-OYfoGTIG7pY-00010 and i said i don't know
rev4-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00002 when you really look at it how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies
rev4-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00003 you learn more about how computers work
rev4-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00004 he wanted to keep score
rev4-Ok6LbV6bqaE-00005 but it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write
rev4-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00003 you board the plane
rev4-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00004 the plane takes off
rev4-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00005 the engine fails
rev4-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00008 no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
rev4-OwgWkUIm9Gc-00009 they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios
rev4-OzA6jRYjVQs-00001 it's about people
rev4-OzA6jRYjVQs-00003 this is not a statement on malnutrition or anything else
rev4-OzA6jRYjVQs-00004 the net outcome
rev4-OzA6jRYjVQs-00006 china is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has available for agriculture and it has massive
rev4-OzA6jRYjVQs-00008 that even small scale farmers can leverage
rev4-OzA6jRYjVQs-00009 we just need to act on it
rev4-P2AUat93a8Q-00002 would you like to create a second one together
rev4-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00001 we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
rev4-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00004 he wouldn't like the answer
rev4-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00005 or any national leader
rev4-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00006 the supreme court has fallen way down from what it used to be
rev4-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00007 they were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites
rev4-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00009 they are doing it together
rev4-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00011 that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or
rev4-PSlBlZ3hqKc-00012 we can create a global parliament of mayors
rev4-PYHd7rpOTe8-00001 but you know what the actual facts are
rev4-PYHd7rpOTe8-00002 but now it's turned around
rev4-PYHd7rpOTe8-00003 then they had to bring them in
rev4-PaxNc5Sqn6s-00001 make it about the other party
rev4-PbgB2TaYhio-00001 well i think about this all the time
rev4-PbgB2TaYhio-00003 they all look the same under a microscope i mean to a first approximation
rev4-PbgB2TaYhio-00004 but now check out where they go on our tree of life
rev4-PbgB2TaYhio-00007 it's just not possible
rev4-PhVP1tNeGyY-00001 how cool is that
rev4-PrK0CifulU0-00003 now hamilton was everything madison was not
rev4-PrK0CifulU0-00004 and they did it in the good old fashioned way
rev4-PrK0CifulU0-00005 first they founded political parties
rev4-Q6U69HbAF9Y-00002 well we bought one of these
rev4-QKHkSUiQboA-00003 it's kind of the anti reality tv
rev4-QKHkSUiQboA-00004 nobody comes to get famous
rev4-QKHkSUiQboA-00005 and it's hard and it takes courage but that's why we're alive right
rev4-QKHkSUiQboA-00007 how are we going to do that
rev4-QeIrdqU0o9s-00002 i am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye
rev4-QeIrdqU0o9s-00004 how far away was the finish line
rev4-QeIrdqU0o9s-00006 so this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster
rev4-QleRgTBMX88-00001 i think this is a problem
rev4-QleRgTBMX88-00002 beth israel's in boston
rev4-QoT0S2vu9m4-00001 that's a terrible waste of time
rev4-QoT0S2vu9m4-00002 do that only if you're paid by the hour
rev4-QoyBYYpal1Y-00001 so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system
rev4-QuIS7J59SYw-00001 that's my question
rev4-RAR4cz9wkUk-00001 i was not going to cry myself to sleep
rev4-RAR4cz9wkUk-00002 i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
rev4-RCXGpEmFbOw-00001 there are no external cameras
rev4-RD07GkmM2fc-00001 in fact it's more like five percent
rev4-RD07GkmM2fc-00004 and we finally figured out how to do it
rev4-RDIy58g9n2k-00002 it's just incredible
rev4-RDSSLJG7oi8-00001 i'm not strong enough to lift my carry on bag from the ground to the carousel
rev4-RE4ce4mexrU-00002 it's not one way
rev4-RE4ce4mexrU-00004 and i thought what am i thinking
rev4-RE4ce4mexrU-00005 he's five years old
rev4-ROgFmb3oTLo-00001 they have different interests
rev4-ROgFmb3oTLo-00002 they have divergent values
rev4-ROgFmb3oTLo-00004 it means for youth and it's a new arab tv channel
rev4-ROgFmb3oTLo-00005 but it's not about fire and brimstone either
rev4-ROgFmb3oTLo-00007 there is an animated series in the works
rev4-ROgFmb3oTLo-00010 and she's looking as young as ever
rev4-RaSlxoAUP5c-00001 i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one
rev4-RaSlxoAUP5c-00003 which means take my camera
rev4-RaSlxoAUP5c-00004 and he thinks i'm saying take my picture
rev4-RiM5aSvaNkg-00001 i went to extreme lengths to try to be straight
rev4-RiM5aSvaNkg-00002 and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this
rev4-RiM5aSvaNkg-00003 but if you won't move we'll have no choice but to run you down
rev4-RlQ3CSVanaU-00001 i don't understand
rev4-RplnSVTzvnU-00001 we can see everything on wikipedia
rev4-RplnSVTzvnU-00002 it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated
rev4-RplnSVTzvnU-00003 we can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly
rev4-Rw9s0ivfn3w-00001 because we can
rev4-S2Dj9M71JAc-00003 so when we met chuck was a senior in high school
rev4-S2Dj9M71JAc-00006 not a single one
rev4-S2Dj9M71JAc-00007 the question for us now is how much can we make of it
rev4-S2Dj9M71JAc-00008 how much can we change
rev4-S6ufvYWTqQ0-00001 he was also the first person to call me a feminist
rev4-S6ufvYWTqQ0-00005 my brothers are not as interested as i am
rev4-S7t6Ry4PlTo-00001 it's been thought about for a while
rev4-SE97Kgi0sR4-00001 think about that
rev4-SE97Kgi0sR4-00002 they also monitored the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
rev4-SE97Kgi0sR4-00003 terrorists are doing this
rev4-SE97Kgi0sR4-00004 when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob
rev4-SE97Kgi0sR4-00005 of course we're going to go even deeper than the human body
rev4-SE97Kgi0sR4-00006 we're going down to the cellular level these days
rev4-SFnMTHhKdkw-00003 we can do this
rev4-SFnMTHhKdkw-00004 i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the worst
rev4-SFnMTHhKdkw-00005 i'm so sorry
rev4-SFnMTHhKdkw-00008 one year i came up with a bright idea
rev4-SFnMTHhKdkw-00009 we know why kids don't learn
rev4-SFnMTHhKdkw-00010 you made it work for me
rev4-SN7wO06Yz1E-00002 and they put on an opera all night long
rev4-SN7wO06Yz1E-00003 what is the abstraction
rev4-SN7wO06Yz1E-00004 it's so obvious
rev4-SN7wO06Yz1E-00005 you don't question that
rev4-SN7wO06Yz1E-00006 that's what moves you
rev4-SN7wO06Yz1E-00008 i'm in the crucible right now
rev4-SN7wO06Yz1E-00009 i know you understand that
rev4-SS8TSf2srSw-00002 seventy five percent of them are women and children
rev4-SS8TSf2srSw-00003 that was her fight
rev4-SS8TSf2srSw-00006 she got a support network
rev4-SS8TSf2srSw-00007 she learned about her rights
rev4-SS8TSf2srSw-00008 she was doing okay
rev4-SSzRfSJTNW4-00001 what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary
rev4-SSzRfSJTNW4-00003 why do we need to study this anymore
rev4-SSzRfSJTNW4-00005 don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization
rev4-SSzRfSJTNW4-00006 indeed we run the risk of making things worse
rev4-SSzRfSJTNW4-00007 imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics
rev4-SWiwSBLXS3k-00001 and not just that
rev4-SWiwSBLXS3k-00002 they met together
rev4-SWiwSBLXS3k-00003 why is it important now
rev4-SWiwSBLXS3k-00008 so what did they do
rev4-SWvJxasiSZ8-00004 but people did not relate to this
rev4-SWvJxasiSZ8-00005 i don't know
rev4-SWvJxasiSZ8-00006 people started contributing ideas
rev4-SWvJxasiSZ8-00009 and that's actually what happened
rev4-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00001 you see there's a lot of things we just don't have data on
rev4-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00002 it's a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world
rev4-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00003 but we're not there yet
rev4-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00004 with that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen
rev4-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00008 data drives better decisions
rev4-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00010 it's a win all around
rev4-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00012 and that's a big deal for a profession that's in high demand
rev4-Sa27SUR0Mlo-00013 there's going to be a new system based on donated package tracking technology from the logistics company that i work for
rev4-SaouBn7IKIo-00001 we've been working together since well since we were kids really
rev4-SaouBn7IKIo-00002 which brought us to this
rev4-Sbm98rrVZzE-00001 but i need your help
rev4-Sddb0Khx0yA-00001 so what to do next
rev4-Sew0bn8mGAA-00002 the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place
rev4-Sew0bn8mGAA-00004 what do they have
rev4-Sew0bn8mGAA-00006 do they have aids
rev4-Sew0bn8mGAA-00007 do they have a common cold
rev4-Sew0bn8mGAA-00009 you make it flow under and over
rev4-Sktdq5z1NS4-00001 and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more
rev4-SmLeSPk3ddE-00001 take a look at these
rev4-SnSHsb5xKPo-00001 it took six days to deploy a global malware campaign
rev4-SnSHsb5xKPo-00002 it should be inspiring
rev4-SpTGUTSFvf4-00001 some did not everybody
rev4-SpTGUTSFvf4-00003 even that wasn't enough
rev4-SpTGUTSFvf4-00004 she wanted to change policy at the government level
rev4-SsqlpgMKjyU-00001 i actually have no idea why
rev4-SsqlpgMKjyU-00002 i didn't talk to them
rev4-SsqlpgMKjyU-00003 go pick up the keys
rev4-Sv5QitqbxJw-00003 they're too busy putting out daily fires to think ahead strategically
rev4-Sv5QitqbxJw-00004 and they don't need to ask for permission
rev4-TDaFwnOiKVE-00002 and i said that's a good job
rev4-TDaFwnOiKVE-00003 this isn't information
rev4-TDaFwnOiKVE-00004 it's super real and it's happening around you
rev4-TGZMSmcuiXM-00001 that's what's so complicated about war
rev4-TGZMSmcuiXM-00002 it was incredibly hot
rev4-TGZMSmcuiXM-00003 how does that work
rev4-TGZMSmcuiXM-00004 it's not what i had expected
rev4-TGZMSmcuiXM-00008 what is it that he misses
rev4-TGZMSmcuiXM-00009 we have to answer that
rev4-TGZMSmcuiXM-00012 the boys are up there for a year
rev4-TGZMSmcuiXM-00013 some of them got out of the army and had tremendous psychological problems when they got home
rev4-TRajLqEaWhQ-00002 that means at some point it's going to be your problem too
rev4-TScetimMBL8-00002 i realize of course that all countries are unique
rev4-TScetimMBL8-00003 that's nothing special
rev4-TScetimMBL8-00004 it had no choice
rev4-TScetimMBL8-00005 again it had no choice
rev4-TScetimMBL8-00006 just when that's the last thing you want to do
rev4-TUgBdSyK7S4-00001 i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
rev4-TUxwiVFgghE-00001 how much they do
rev4-TVtgb153S6I-00001 and we connected over really small things like the fact that i love country music which is really
rev4-TVtgb153S6I-00002 this is not a photo profile for your facebook
rev4-U6FvJ6jMGHU-00002 that didn't go over really well
rev4-U6FvJ6jMGHU-00003 so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free
rev4-U6PoUg7jXsA-00001 the answer was no
rev4-U6PoUg7jXsA-00002 do you remember what it was
rev4-U6PoUg7jXsA-00004 and i got pretty into it
rev4-U6PoUg7jXsA-00005 this is how stuff is made memorable
rev4-UAinLaT42xY-00001 what makes technology useful and usable
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00001 i will craft my own drum
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00003 i will not be played
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00006 we mourn women complicated
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00011 i live cycles of light and darkness
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00012 rhythm is half silence
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00013 i see now i never was one and not the other
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00014 sickness health tender violence
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00016 one woman loses her head
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00017 one woman feeds on trash
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00018 one woman shoots her face
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00019 one woman straps herself
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00020 one woman gives birth to a baby
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00021 one woman gives birth to borders
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00022 one woman no longer believes love will ever find her
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00023 one woman never did
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00024 where do refugee hearts go
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00025 faced with absence
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00027 my spine curves spiral
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00028 cluster bombs left behind
rev4-UAj1hsXp18c-00030 harvest contaminated tobacco
rev4-UAq4yBdSYZs-00001 so after 25 years i began to feel as though i was running dry
rev4-UAq4yBdSYZs-00002 they will sit in them forever
rev4-UK8ccWSZkic-00001 of those seven have nuclear weapons
rev4-ULNPLFrTirQ-00001 i'm pushing and pulling with this object
rev4-UMhLBPPtlrY-00002 she got unlucky
rev4-UMhLBPPtlrY-00004 what if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all
rev4-UMhLBPPtlrY-00005 that wasn't being asked
rev4-UZmXwOgNq7c-00001 only one percent of the people are actually farmers
rev4-UZmXwOgNq7c-00002 so what can we do
rev4-UZmXwOgNq7c-00005 talk to farmers
rev4-UmvOgW6iV2s-00001 casual speech is something quite different
rev4-UmvOgW6iV2s-00002 that's what texting is
rev4-UmvOgW6iV2s-00003 it's a marker of empathy
rev4-UmvOgW6iV2s-00004 any spoken language that's used by real people has them
rev4-UmvOgW6iV2s-00007 texting has developed one from this slash
rev4-Us70DN2XSfM-00001 like why did i really have to mow the lawn
rev4-Us70DN2XSfM-00002 you can't run around in the dark
rev4-Us70DN2XSfM-00003 you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
rev4-Us70DN2XSfM-00005 and it's not that they didn't want me to think critically
rev4-UtBsl3j0YRQ-00002 you haven't earned it
rev4-UtBsl3j0YRQ-00004 we have to get quiet
rev4-UtBsl3j0YRQ-00006 how can we do it
rev4-V1yW5IsnSjo-00001 i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trap disguised as love one
rev4-V1yW5IsnSjo-00003 which is why that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future
rev4-V1yW5IsnSjo-00004 and here's where those guns come in
rev4-V1yW5IsnSjo-00005 he kept one in the glove compartment of our car
rev4-V1yW5IsnSjo-00006 i had just graduated from harvard college
rev4-V1yW5IsnSjo-00008 the question why does she stay
rev4-V1yW5IsnSjo-00009 show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your coworkers your friends and
rev4-V4sSabKqyMU-00001 but there's so much potential
rev4-V4sSabKqyMU-00002 and i went back home and i said daddy i don't know who i am
rev4-V4sSabKqyMU-00003 so since then i've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
rev4-V4sSabKqyMU-00004 brought in younger men
rev4-V4sSabKqyMU-00005 it's about proving who you are and what you can do
rev4-V4sSabKqyMU-00006 and this is true
rev4-VAJS5J21Rd0-00001 are they attractive
rev4-VAJS5J21Rd0-00003 are they a potential mate
rev4-VAJS5J21Rd0-00004 when you're six maybe you can do that
rev4-VAJS5J21Rd0-00005 i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
rev4-VAJS5J21Rd0-00008 how old are you
rev4-VAJS5J21Rd0-00009 so i changed my immediate goal to 10000 faces
rev4-VIgzTLDyObo-00001 so momentum is good
rev4-VIgzTLDyObo-00002 often what happens is you're planning so hard for like how do i get through the hardest part
rev4-VIgzTLDyObo-00003 how do i get through the hardest part
rev4-VIgzTLDyObo-00004 and then what happens
rev4-VSLurJfOSiA-00001 and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things
rev4-VSLurJfOSiA-00002 you were born to
rev4-VSLurJfOSiA-00005 that's what we do
rev4-VfAiNX7jn9A-00001 young people as well
rev4-VfAiNX7jn9A-00004 and that's what we did
rev4-VfAiNX7jn9A-00006 we hear the chaos of war
rev4-VfAiNX7jn9A-00007 we hear terrorism
rev4-VfAiNX7jn9A-00010 the silent majority does not need to be silent
rev4-VfAiNX7jn9A-00011 let's help them have a voice
rev4-VfAiNX7jn9A-00012 thank you very much
rev4-VsjTVGIw4z8-00003 and we all know this
rev4-VsjTVGIw4z8-00005 okay then we can make a mobile geiger counter
rev4-VsjTVGIw4z8-00006 we can drive around
rev4-VsjTVGIw4z8-00007 we can get volunteers
rev4-VsjTVGIw4z8-00008 we don't have enough money
rev4-VxESitIllxE-00001 and then we were alarmed to discover something
rev4-VxESitIllxE-00002 no plankton means no fish
rev4-VxESitIllxE-00004 as an inventor i try and turn fantasy into reality
rev4-VxESitIllxE-00007 not when you get lung cancer
rev4-VzyjDRSAWzE-00001 it's an unconscious process
rev4-VzyjDRSAWzE-00002 it's an automatic process
rev4-WFCvkkDSfIU-00002 one way around this is to draw pictures
rev4-WFCvkkDSfIU-00003 and this idea is actually nothing new
rev4-WT7VMrxTPPA-00001 there's no other way
rev4-WT7VMrxTPPA-00003 i mean i thought poetry was just self expression
rev4-WT7VMrxTPPA-00004 i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
rev4-WTFi99e4RXU-00001 only we don't know that it's a homeless shelter
rev4-XBJQENjZJaA-00001 5 percent today
rev4-XBJQENjZJaA-00002 how is that possible
rev4-XBJQENjZJaA-00003 that's different from actually having an effective ad campaign
rev4-XESFPEFpHt4-00001 where would it go
rev4-XESFPEFpHt4-00002 you can walk around them
rev4-XESFPEFpHt4-00003 was the internet actually a place that you could visit
rev4-XESFPEFpHt4-00004 could i go there
rev4-XESFPEFpHt4-00005 who would i meet
rev4-XESFPEFpHt4-00007 the whole internet
rev4-XESFPEFpHt4-00008 is it heavy
rev4-XESFPEFpHt4-00010 i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for
rev4-XESFPEFpHt4-00011 you can experience their sense of place
rev4-XESFPEFpHt4-00013 we let other people worry about it
rev4-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00001 so i learned never to move
rev4-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00005 it would skip a beat
rev4-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00006 it would start
rev4-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00007 it would stop
rev4-XFnGhrCS3Gs-00008 and i felt all this
rev4-XNbaR54Gpj4-00001 does any of this matter
rev4-XYNUpQrZISc-00001 why is that hard
rev4-XYNUpQrZISc-00002 that will change everything when we see that
rev4-YD5PFdghryc-00001 and so many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where i would walk across borders
rev4-YyXRYgjQXX0-00001 the answer to that question is a very definitive
rev4-YyXRYgjQXX0-00002 and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers that i would never sell them one of our crappy products
rev4-YyXRYgjQXX0-00007 it's all about what can you do for me
rev4-YyXRYgjQXX0-00008 agreeable people are warm and friendly they're nice they're polite
rev4-YyXRYgjQXX0-00010 whereas giving and taking are more of your inner motives what are your values
rev4-YyXRYgjQXX0-00011 what are your intentions toward others
rev4-YyXRYgjQXX0-00013 they'll say i'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks
rev4-YzGjO5aHShQ-00002 and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the
rev4-YzGjO5aHShQ-00004 i was talking about interaction design
rev4-YzGjO5aHShQ-00005 and does it matter
rev4-YzGjO5aHShQ-00006 you know it's like once again there's this whole problem of design being often misunderstood for art
rev4-YzGjO5aHShQ-00007 designers aspire to be really great designers
rev4-YzGjO5aHShQ-00012 what we want what we aspire to is the code
rev4-YzGjO5aHShQ-00013 it's very hard to get of course
rev4-YzGjO5aHShQ-00016 we're going to stay with them forever
rev4-YzGjO5aHShQ-00017 i mean that interface is beautiful
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00001 it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in trenton
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00002 now at that time camden new jersey was the most dangerous city in america
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00003 i ran the camden police department because of that
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00004 and they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00005 and one of them said we had a robbery two weeks ago
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00007 we have no suspects
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00008 we have no suspects
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00012 it worked for the oakland a's and it worked in the state of new jersey
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00013 we took camden off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in america
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00016 and all of this matters greatly because public safety to me is the most important function of
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00019 they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00020 they're just waiting for their day in court
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00021 and 67 percent of people come back
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00023 so when i started my job at the arnold foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00024 and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i feel the exact same way that i did about the state of
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00025 so i decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make the most critical decision
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00026 it impacts everything
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00027 it impacts sentencing
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00029 it impacts crime and violence
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00030 and when i talk to judges around the united states which i do all the time now they all say the same
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00031 but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00033 and i couldn't get this information out
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00035 and at the other end of the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00037 they're like the baseball scouts 20 years ago
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00044 some people call it data science
rev4-ZJNESMhIxQ0-00047 they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
rev4-Zd71719SG8Y-00001 thank you very much
rev4-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00001 but things have changed
rev4-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00004 but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
rev4-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00006 and that's exactly what that is
rev4-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00007 we do train them however to adjust caution according to where they are
rev4-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00008 out to dinner with family
rev4-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00009 you remember carlos
rev4-ZnCSUBmeRxw-00010 he wanted to sit where he could scan the room where he could plan escape routes where he could get his hands
rev4-Zo62S0ulqhA-00001 how do you change your behavior
rev4-Zo62S0ulqhA-00003 he could come over and help me
rev4-aSavBsX60Ss-00001 and it doesn't
rev4-aSavBsX60Ss-00003 so naturally i asked what is african
rev4-akiQuyhXR8o-00001 i don't look different
rev4-akiQuyhXR8o-00002 i'm not short
rev4-akiQuyhXR8o-00003 again let's just play
rev4-akiQuyhXR8o-00004 i needed an education
rev4-akiQuyhXR8o-00005 now i'm ready for my interview
rev4-akiQuyhXR8o-00006 i was right there with you
rev4-akiQuyhXR8o-00007 did i get my upgrade
rev4-akiQuyhXR8o-00010 we must adopt that way of giving back
rev4-akiQuyhXR8o-00011 that doesn't probably happen every day
rev4-aoGJP02CtPA-00002 if any child is found violating these rules he is severely reprimanded
rev4-aoGJP02CtPA-00003 effectively the taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information
rev4-aoGJP02CtPA-00004 their parents are so poor they have no resources to get them back
rev4-aupPrDnhrKA-00001 thank you for your time
rev4-aupPrDnhrKA-00002 i'll let you continue
rev4-b6YTQJVzwlI-00001 so what happens next
rev4-bArH8r8jJ4g-00001 it turns out the evidence says otherwise
rev4-bArH8r8jJ4g-00002 none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people
rev4-bArH8r8jJ4g-00004 it's a pretty simple idea right
rev4-bS6SiVz1R0o-00001 it is the default option
rev4-bS6SiVz1R0o-00002 you just move away
rev4-bS6SiVz1R0o-00003 you're more cautious
rev4-bS6SiVz1R0o-00004 and you walk around and it points to things
rev4-c0KYU2j0TM4-00001 that is great
rev4-c0KYU2j0TM4-00002 thank you very much
rev4-c64M1tZyWPM-00001 so why is it
rev4-c64M1tZyWPM-00002 why aren't people washing their hands
rev4-c64M1tZyWPM-00003 did you learn to wash your hands at home
rev4-c64M1tZyWPM-00004 did you learn to wash your hands in school
rev4-c9V6OKlY80k-00001 but i love it for a totally different reason
rev4-c9V6OKlY80k-00002 they make sense of the past
rev4-cHRZ6OrSvvI-00001 three billion people today with cell phones can't access the internet
rev4-cHRZ6OrSvvI-00002 don't create solutions to impress customers
rev4-cmpu58yv8Sg-00001 we harbor bias
rev4-cmpu58yv8Sg-00002 we know that we are right and they are wrong
rev4-cmpu58yv8Sg-00004 well that's what i thought
rev4-cmpu58yv8Sg-00005 if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video for example your answer
rev4-cmpu58yv8Sg-00007 harness your internal strength
rev4-d3syTrElgcg-00001 look at the end to see the animal
rev4-d6NKdnZvdoo-00002 just think about it
rev4-d6NKdnZvdoo-00003 but it's a global phenomenon
rev4-dS8n24ZwZcQ-00001 one billion people
rev4-dS8n24ZwZcQ-00002 but the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate
rev4-dYNc3P4jSt4-00001 so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
rev4-dYNc3P4jSt4-00004 she never had to duck and cover under her desk at school
rev4-dYNc3P4jSt4-00006 but before that cooperation could be realized kennedy was assassinated and that part of the
rev4-dYNc3P4jSt4-00007 but it's also an important date for another reason
rev4-dYNc3P4jSt4-00008 have inspired a generation of innovators
rev4-ddxHlkIuHqg-00001 i'm a doctor
rev4-ddxHlkIuHqg-00002 but too often my treatments made them feel worse
rev4-ddxHlkIuHqg-00004 we can do that because we know
rev4-eNAHVnkll5M-00001 who cleans up after us
rev4-eNAHVnkll5M-00002 i wanted to get to know them as individuals
rev4-eNAHVnkll5M-00003 i wanted to understand who takes the job
rev4-eNAHVnkll5M-00004 so i started a research project with them
rev4-eNAHVnkll5M-00005 it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
rev4-eNAHVnkll5M-00008 the economy needs them
rev4-eNAHVnkll5M-00011 take a moment to say thank you
rev4-eVFYhbHpfqU-00001 please sign here right now
rev4-eVFYhbHpfqU-00002 why does a jellyfish emit light
rev4-eVFYhbHpfqU-00003 or a firefly
rev4-eVFYhbHpfqU-00007 and that's powerful
rev4-eVFYhbHpfqU-00008 no not how much
rev4-eVFYhbHpfqU-00009 it's more annoying
rev4-eVFYhbHpfqU-00011 it goes wrong
rev4-eZj5n8ScTkI-00001 i couldn't tear myself away from the coverage
rev4-eZj5n8ScTkI-00002 and others resented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights and
rev4-eZj5n8ScTkI-00003 and this wasn't just an abstract question
rev4-eZj5n8ScTkI-00005 african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded
rev4-emW1TQ290ec-00001 can we really scale this up
rev4-eqsXcSaefKI-00001 everything in the universe wears out
rev4-eqsXcSaefKI-00002 and that blew my mind
rev4-esD6aaIjhek-00001 they don't have meaning
rev4-fC9da6eqaqg-00001 you're doing incredibly important work
rev4-fIICVeGW4RY-00001 you are a healer in a stone age village
rev4-fIICVeGW4RY-00003 but eventually they did come around
rev4-fIICVeGW4RY-00004 and so it's perfect for something like that
rev4-fIICVeGW4RY-00006 we need to see beyond the surface
rev4-fTSXvLzNd0o-00002 there won't be a single moment in the schedule
rev4-fZ8eyWBQmfU-00001 now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic
rev4-fscaRh2OtXk-00002 i am sick to my stomach
rev4-fscaRh2OtXk-00003 how do you know for sure
rev4-fscaRh2OtXk-00004 we created a diagnostic test
rev4-fxbCHn6gE3U-00001 i'm the opposite
rev4-fxbCHn6gE3U-00003 then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are
rev4-fxbCHn6gE3U-00005 so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get better at my job i just need to upgrade my browser
rev4-fxbCHn6gE3U-00007 they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all
rev4-fxbCHn6gE3U-00008 they have bad ideas
rev4-gSycQufrgK4-00001 that's next to impossible
rev4-gSycQufrgK4-00002 so i went in that direction
rev4-gVfgkFaswn4-00001 this is a crisis that's getting worse day by day
rev4-gVfgkFaswn4-00002 so the answer to the second question can we change
rev4-gVfgkFaswn4-00003 we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
rev4-gVfgkFaswn4-00006 but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is
rev4-gtpTd3ywwiE-00001 but that's kind of a big problem
rev4-hQigUH0vZSE-00001 and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
rev4-hiIcwt88o94-00001 i just disagree with this
rev4-hiIcwt88o94-00002 like we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share
rev4-hiIcwt88o94-00003 and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity man or woman
rev4-hiIcwt88o94-00005 i want to go
rev4-hiIcwt88o94-00006 and i was like oh the amazon
rev4-hiIcwt88o94-00008 they grow crops
rev4-hiIcwt88o94-00010 there's people everywhere
rev4-hiIcwt88o94-00017 and this is crazy
rev4-hiIcwt88o94-00018 and i'm sure the figures are similar in other countries
rev4-hiIcwt88o94-00019 every kid lives near nature
rev4-hiIcwt88o94-00020 we've just somehow forgotten how to see it
rev4-hiIcwt88o94-00023 there's pollination going on
rev4-hxsnKwmW0dk-00002 we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
rev4-hxsnKwmW0dk-00003 i have an idea for saving the world
rev4-iPE2SiCCo0w-00001 most of my friends were taking japanese
rev4-iPE2SiCCo0w-00002 so i thought why not punish myself
rev4-iPE2SiCCo0w-00004 i was always very small
rev4-iPE2SiCCo0w-00007 so water was something that scared me to begin with
rev4-iPE2SiCCo0w-00008 but i would go in on occasion
rev4-iPE2SiCCo0w-00009 and i thought this would be great fun
rev4-iPE2SiCCo0w-00013 and this routine went on for some time
rev4-iPE2SiCCo0w-00015 i tried everything
rev4-iPE2SiCCo0w-00018 and this became my holy grail my rosetta stone
rev4-iPE2SiCCo0w-00021 and now i love languages
rev4-iPE2SiCCo0w-00023 i know nothing
rev4-iqEHuBST2qQ-00001 and then i thought there's got to be a better way
rev4-j7fRIGphgtk-00001 well i didn't have any idea
rev4-j7fRIGphgtk-00002 our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
rev4-j7fRIGphgtk-00004 i had to have faith
rev4-j7fRIGphgtk-00005 it would be a mall and not a park
rev4-jPf0LjZAS14-00001 is it about earning as much as you possibly can
rev4-jPf0LjZAS14-00003 how should we work
rev4-jPf0LjZAS14-00004 how should we live
rev4-jPf0LjZAS14-00008 we need portable health benefits
rev4-jPf0LjZAS14-00009 i would never want to do that
rev4-jPf0LjZAS14-00010 we need to reinvent labor organizing
rev4-jbHpF7EySck-00001 they want to be part of it
rev4-jbHpF7EySck-00002 and they say i want to work in global poverty but what will it mean about my career
rev4-jcSSY9rDN2g-00001 there's a flip side as well
rev4-jcSSY9rDN2g-00002 it's shocking to realize that only 28 percent of american
rev4-jcp5vvxtEaU-00001 how do you get informed
rev4-jcp5vvxtEaU-00002 we paid two to three times more than anybody else
rev4-jcp5vvxtEaU-00004 there's no more of it
rev4-jcp5vvxtEaU-00006 let's go back and visit our equation
rev4-jcp5vvxtEaU-00008 we're not going to be able to do that
rev4-jcp5vvxtEaU-00009 even if we get everybody working on it we've got to be strategic
rev4-jcp5vvxtEaU-00010 so we did the analysis again a slightly different way
rev4-jcp5vvxtEaU-00011 so it's the demand that brings them to the table
rev4-jcp5vvxtEaU-00012 sustainability has got to be a pre competitive issue
rev4-jggHw5PdQV0-00001 and my whole world did open up
rev4-jggHw5PdQV0-00002 and who does that benefit
rev4-jggHw5PdQV0-00003 we now have a platform
rev4-jiUKpX09zo4-00001 it really is quite phenomenal
rev4-jtVIDBs60S8-00001 that was powerful
rev4-jtVIDBs60S8-00004 it's actually not that hard
rev4-jtVIDBs60S8-00005 raise your hands
rev4-k2hQL9Zrokk-00001 take my child
rev4-k2hQL9Zrokk-00002 i believe a story there has to be told
rev4-k2hQL9Zrokk-00003 they don't get their money out
rev4-k2hQL9Zrokk-00005 she worked in a bank
rev4-k2hQL9Zrokk-00006 i have to report it
rev4-k2hQL9Zrokk-00008 who cares about bosnia
rev4-kEKzl6fub2w-00001 which incidentally is only a third correct
rev4-kEKzl6fub2w-00002 i don't mean giving up the internet
rev4-kEKzl6fub2w-00003 this is your chance
rev4-ka8L1YMR88U-00001 that didn't happen to me
rev4-ka8L1YMR88U-00004 make it go away
rev4-ka8L1YMR88U-00005 make it go away
rev4-ka8L1YMR88U-00006 make it go away
rev4-ka8L1YMR88U-00008 we can't identify with that part
rev4-kcEIsbO0ivA-00001 you might get impeached for that
rev4-kwYxHPXIaao-00001 well not yet
rev4-l5vZHuAtDZA-00001 well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
rev4-l5vZHuAtDZA-00003 so was mother teresa
rev4-lmyZMtPVodo-00001 that is some deep deep emotion when you would want to do that
rev4-lmyZMtPVodo-00002 we have no control over these forces
rev4-lrSmXnUoUXM-00002 well guess what
rev4-lrSmXnUoUXM-00003 now i know why i'm here
rev4-m6X1i8khmt8-00001 and i was really scared
rev4-m6X1i8khmt8-00002 the irony is so obvious right
rev4-m6X1i8khmt8-00004 but i found one
rev4-mSHBma0Ithk-00001 they want to get out
rev4-mSHBma0Ithk-00002 allow many people to come in
rev4-mSHBma0Ithk-00003 let us have a hong kong nearby
rev4-mSHBma0Ithk-00006 when we share ideas we all get more
rev4-mc0vhSseGk4-00001 so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really
rev4-mgcjr1yz7ow-00002 is it about systems
rev4-mgcjr1yz7ow-00003 is it about equality
rev4-mgcjr1yz7ow-00005 i started looking at them really carefully
rev4-mgcjr1yz7ow-00006 i looked at my friend who drilled seven dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
rev4-mgcjr1yz7ow-00008 these guys could be true to their purpose which was finding oil and gas
rev4-mgcjr1yz7ow-00009 and they were basically having fun
rev4-mgcjr1yz7ow-00013 we need to be part of a community to survive
rev4-mgcjr1yz7ow-00015 it's very hard to make them part of our rational decision
rev4-mgcjr1yz7ow-00016 we all know deep inside what the answer is
rev4-mgcjr1yz7ow-00017 we've known since we were babies
rev4-mjDjbJJlqZ0-00001 we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place
rev4-mxNpNuogqsY-00003 what are the researchers learning
rev4-mxNpNuogqsY-00004 so i was jealous
rev4-mxNpNuogqsY-00005 i know i didn't
rev4-mxNpNuogqsY-00006 i think i'm a normal person
rev4-n3kNlFMXslo-00002 that's like finding an extra hour in the day
rev4-n3kNlFMXslo-00003 yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found
rev4-n3kNlFMXslo-00005 so how do we do that
rev4-n3kNlFMXslo-00006 but you can write it
rev4-n3kNlFMXslo-00010 you say you're working more than 60 hours
rev4-n3kNlFMXslo-00011 well are you sure
rev4-n3kNlFMXslo-00012 and that's even if you're working way more than full time hours
rev4-n3kNlFMXslo-00013 we don't even need that much time to do amazing things
rev4-nASJ0510Pxs-00002 so they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them
rev4-nASJ0510Pxs-00003 thanks very much
rev4-nCg2NcGYu34-00001 why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
rev4-nCg2NcGYu34-00004 he also had 11 children
rev4-nCg2NcGYu34-00006 not the wife not the kids
rev4-nCg2NcGYu34-00008 i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
rev4-nCg2NcGYu34-00009 please look at me
rev4-nCg2NcGYu34-00011 who is going to inherit his name and his fortune
rev4-nCg2NcGYu34-00012 he should not have been surprised
rev4-nG3vB2CuSjM-00001 not right now
rev4-ni4FV5zL6lM-00001 government officials are extremely mad
rev4-ni4FV5zL6lM-00003 but those surveillance features come at a cost
rev4-npNYP2vzaPo-00001 how can we get so much information out of so little motion
rev4-npNYP2vzaPo-00002 we would just get noise back
rev4-npNYP2vzaPo-00004 we push and pull and poke and prod things
rev4-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00001 how do you find a dinosaur
rev4-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00002 that's the magic of the geological record
rev4-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00003 but we only get one history and it's the one that we have
rev4-o1Z4F4e2Bw4-00004 but this particular reality was not inevitable
rev4-oDNgnrtSD8w-00001 come on man
rev4-oYp5XuGYqqY-00002 we were wrong
rev4-oYp5XuGYqqY-00003 now that's a very very good point
rev4-ooAIIeo4AJQ-00001 you smell money
rev4-ooAIIeo4AJQ-00002 we wouldn't tolerate that
rev4-ooAIIeo4AJQ-00003 thank you very much
rev4-os69gEFXUW4-00001 what can i learn with you
rev4-pFDoCLf96Kg-00001 and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance
rev4-pnv5iKB2hl4-00001 i don't care
rev4-psN1DORYYV0-00002 at what point did i think that was a good idea
rev4-psN1DORYYV0-00004 she said yeah
rev4-psN1DORYYV0-00005 why did you bring this up
rev4-psN1DORYYV0-00006 have you lost your mind
rev4-psN1DORYYV0-00008 i'm a fifth generation texan
rev4-psN1DORYYV0-00012 it's the best way to shut people down on an airplane
rev4-psN1DORYYV0-00013 what do you do
rev4-psN1DORYYV0-00014 i study shame
rev4-psN1DORYYV0-00016 i guess i'm doing it right now
rev4-psN1DORYYV0-00017 your wife left you
rev4-psN1DORYYV0-00018 i made a mistake
rev4-psN1DORYYV0-00019 and here's what you need to know
rev4-psN1DORYYV0-00020 he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms
rev4-q2gO4DKVpa8-00001 i am certainly not the hardest working
rev4-q2gO4DKVpa8-00002 i was a mediocre student
rev4-q2gO4DKVpa8-00004 it has never happened
rev4-q2gO4DKVpa8-00005 i was the first non family investor in amazon
rev4-q2gO4DKVpa8-00006 this is nonsense
rev4-qWNae7vYK6s-00001 thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame
rev4-qWNae7vYK6s-00002 and when she went to complain to a major he said what
rev4-qWNae7vYK6s-00003 again in a car
rev4-qWNae7vYK6s-00004 i was petrified
rev4-qWNae7vYK6s-00006 sexual harassment doesn't discriminate
rev4-qWNae7vYK6s-00007 not a lot of hands
rev4-qWNae7vYK6s-00008 you don't get the same witnesses or depositions
rev4-qWNae7vYK6s-00009 they just do it
rev4-qYUmI5kGsYk-00001 so we need the solutions and these people playing the game they are trying out
rev4-qafSjNLjedo-00001 and we've all heard that kind of story before right
rev4-qlty0OPcU6k-00001 now do something different
rev4-qlty0OPcU6k-00002 that would not work
rev4-qsJYrwzfd6w-00004 and after that initial prototype we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have
rev4-qsJYrwzfd6w-00005 and then guess what
rev4-qsJYrwzfd6w-00006 could we leverage the cloud
rev4-qsJYrwzfd6w-00007 so why don't we leverage that
rev4-rBKV4rOgSJU-00008 and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
rev4-rFpDK2KhAgw-00001 they have social meaning
rev4-rFpDK2KhAgw-00002 they were unexpected pleasures
rev4-rFpDK2KhAgw-00003 sometimes it goes further
rev4-rFpDK2KhAgw-00006 or where does he live
rev4-rFpDK2KhAgw-00007 strangers might ask each other for a sip of water
rev4-rGfhahVBIQw-00001 and this leads to oddities
rev4-rGfhahVBIQw-00002 but this is the source of innovation
rev4-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00001 well why is that
rev4-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00002 now i will maintain
rev4-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00005 what difference does it make if they talk like jerry seinfeld
rev4-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00006 i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
rev4-rP7nmdDA1Fg-00007 well what difference does this make
rev4-rSSanSYZDT4-00001 and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive
rev4-rSSanSYZDT4-00002 what makes the heart unique
rev4-rZCxdbqMc2Q-00001 i will be back
rev4-rftagV38YKY-00001 i didn't know where i was
rev4-s0YjL9rZyR0-00003 this is not a put down of anyone
rev4-s0YjL9rZyR0-00004 it is wrong
rev4-s0YjL9rZyR0-00005 it is irresponsible
rev4-s0YjL9rZyR0-00007 are we brave enough to welcome it
rev4-s0YjL9rZyR0-00008 but it's different
rev4-s4smjT1qwZU-00002 there's no structure
rev4-sVtIuDKFO1c-00001 getting a college education is a 20 year investment
rev4-sVtIuDKFO1c-00003 when you grow up poor you want to be rich
rev4-shG0ezBeeJc-00001 how could i let them down
rev4-shG0ezBeeJc-00002 sometimes it's messy and it's always unpredictable
rev4-stngBN4hp14-00001 about a year after 9 11 researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world
rev4-sxnlvwprfSc-00001 i teach at stanford
rev4-sxnlvwprfSc-00002 i'm a physician practicing with cutting edge technology
rev4-sxnlvwprfSc-00003 we're losing a ritual
rev4-sxnlvwprfSc-00007 this is when i was in texas
rev4-sxnlvwprfSc-00008 they had her scanned inside out
rev4-sxnlvwprfSc-00011 i would listen to the heart
rev4-t2gbcVaZ448-00002 after all i was a bit unconventional
rev4-t2gbcVaZ448-00003 i've struggled to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them
rev4-t2gbcVaZ448-00004 what if i had told her my story years ago
rev4-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00001 so you want to go to that board meeting but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest
rev4-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00002 that robot put on a great show
rev4-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00004 we almost don't feel ourselves
rev4-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00005 so what do we do
rev4-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00006 we connect more and more
rev4-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00007 when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
rev4-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00008 and that's what i'm calling for here now
rev4-t7Xr3AsBEK4-00009 do the same thing at work
rev4-ta2Wvy9FSgA-00001 that's pretty cool
rev4-ta2Wvy9FSgA-00002 we have the plan
rev4-ta2Wvy9FSgA-00003 but if they don't stay in paris the international pressure will be overwhelming
rev4-tbSWdVA4Sbo-00001 we might say then well let's not worry about this
rev4-tgSCwQwYNjc-00001 women's day was coming up
rev4-tiSiSM3pk5M-00002 well let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
rev4-tiSiSM3pk5M-00003 what can i do about it
rev4-tiSiSM3pk5M-00005 it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it
rev4-tiSiSM3pk5M-00009 you've broken your back
rev4-tiSiSM3pk5M-00010 you'll never walk again
rev4-tiSiSM3pk5M-00012 it's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away
rev4-tzJYY2p0QIc-00001 growing up i was always intrigued by how people change
rev4-tzJYY2p0QIc-00003 that's not to say it's impossible
rev4-u4L130DkdOw-00001 and how is that possible
rev4-uJr4wGcLNsA-00001 she never wanted to tell me
rev4-uJr4wGcLNsA-00003 my parents came from germany
rev4-uJr4wGcLNsA-00005 some of them were really afraid of contagion and they wouldn't even walk in front of our
rev4-uJr4wGcLNsA-00007 so what was i going to do
rev4-uJr4wGcLNsA-00009 constance baker motley
rev4-uJr4wGcLNsA-00010 that is the right answer
rev4-uL5XUwfkxZw-00002 and work like a dog
rev4-uL5XUwfkxZw-00003 that's your grandfather
rev4-uL5XUwfkxZw-00004 tell me about that
rev4-uL5XUwfkxZw-00006 and that's all
rev4-uL5XUwfkxZw-00007 they were all white
rev4-uL5XUwfkxZw-00008 so they felt safe to come there
rev4-uL5XUwfkxZw-00011 we didn't understand the program
rev4-uL5XUwfkxZw-00013 i said we work together
rev4-uL5XUwfkxZw-00015 i may never go to your house you may never come to my house
rev4-uqS6T6TAu74-00001 i became a psychology researcher and i've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
rev4-uzKBGtf0i0M-00002 and it is important
rev4-uzKBGtf0i0M-00004 without it we literally can't interface with others
rev4-uzKBGtf0i0M-00005 my history wasn't right
rev4-uzKBGtf0i0M-00007 my desire to disappear was still very powerful
rev4-uzKBGtf0i0M-00008 i take it to therapy
rev4-vGX3FASrQq4-00001 thank you very much
rev4-vXPJVwwEmiM-00001 he's at a technology conference in florida
rev4-vXPJVwwEmiM-00004 you probably won't
rev4-vXPJVwwEmiM-00005 nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
rev4-vXPJVwwEmiM-00006 most independent media was shut down
rev4-vXPJVwwEmiM-00007 we have to fix the internet
rev4-vXPJVwwEmiM-00008 we have to fix our education
rev4-vhVWzkbAW4I-00002 it showed no blockages
rev4-vhVWzkbAW4I-00003 but linda was lucky
rev4-vhVWzkbAW4I-00004 she found us we found her disease
rev4-vhVWzkbAW4I-00005 but for too many women that's not the case
rev4-vhVWzkbAW4I-00007 the authors looked at papers written over a 10 year period and hundreds had to be thrown out
rev4-vhVWzkbAW4I-00008 we know that every cell has a sex
rev4-vhVWzkbAW4I-00011 we have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum
rev4-vhVWzkbAW4I-00012 and it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine
rev4-w1R4F9sSoow-00001 we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just iraq and afghanistan
rev4-w1R4F9sSoow-00003 we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own work
rev4-w1R4F9sSoow-00005 i do believe we can fix what's broken
rev4-w1R4F9sSoow-00006 we all want to
rev4-wG4RnDNWtJo-00001 that was a huge problem at the haiti earthquake
rev4-wG4RnDNWtJo-00003 we lost valuable data
rev4-wG4RnDNWtJo-00004 it's about the data
rev4-wGMLhaa98GI-00001 i can hardly wait
rev4-wKlMcLTqRLs-00001 why did my child develop autism
rev4-wlR1ojoiue0-00001 they were wonderful people
rev4-wlR1ojoiue0-00004 this is possible
rev4-wlR1ojoiue0-00005 the world's companies governments and non profits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this
rev4-wmMrZyVANUo-00001 and in many cases we don't
rev4-wmMrZyVANUo-00002 but we all should
rev4-wmMrZyVANUo-00003 this will pay dividends
rev4-wzkFoetpSSM-00002 i feel that god knows me
rev4-wzkFoetpSSM-00004 and i thought we should just stay home
rev4-wzkFoetpSSM-00005 the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
rev4-wzkFoetpSSM-00007 so we decided to go to the mosque
rev4-x4m6j7rSyzY-00001 i know it works
rev4-x95nwilkaio-00001 but i grew up in canada far from my arab roots
rev4-x95nwilkaio-00002 they have been sold by their families often to wealthy arab tourists
rev4-x95nwilkaio-00003 this is just one face of a booming sex trade across the arab region
rev4-x95nwilkaio-00005 social change doesn't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation
rev4-xFSCX9mAHPo-00001 we're not playing with each other
rev4-xFSCX9mAHPo-00002 there's a million different ways to eat pizza
rev4-xFSCX9mAHPo-00003 if we're still hungry we might have some more
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00004 all of you are members of tribes
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00007 you don't want this
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00008 this is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00009 and i want to make the point that as members of society we need to
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00012 if you want this experience to live on as something historic then at the reception
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00014 but we're not done yet
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00015 it comes out of a place called the gallup organization
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00016 you know they do polls right
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00019 pretty much everybody else who does polls
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00020 so i'd like to leave you with these thoughts
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00021 the group gels
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00023 but you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00024 there was no road map
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00025 in fact south africa has not gone down that road
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00027 life is great
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00031 what about martin luther king
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00034 and he grew up essentially in stage one
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00035 my life really sucks
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00036 i don't know anybody
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00038 but i don't
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00039 you're hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people a tribe about how
rev4-xTkKSJSqUSI-00040 and you don't leave them where they are
rev4-xkFTZcUPjBg-00001 i was going through a hard time as well
rev4-xkFTZcUPjBg-00002 i was like what
rev4-xkFTZcUPjBg-00003 what about you
rev4-xlUPlxSpDRo-00001 you don't have to bring any quarters because the washer and dryer are free
rev4-xukDIWFMU9Y-00002 look at this pretty structure
rev4-xukDIWFMU9Y-00003 has a coherent movement
rev4-y1KIVZw7Jxk-00003 that's not an improbable sample
rev4-y1KIVZw7Jxk-00004 you can navigate space
rev4-y1KIVZw7Jxk-00005 you know about numbers
rev4-y6MC4iXhT6I-00001 we're looking for something more
rev4-yMWlkJAqKYU-00001 how is that possible
rev4-yNhu0MGS2MA-00001 why not just let businesses compete
rev4-yeVz0rtXCmw-00001 i started to walk in the community and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't
rev4-yeVz0rtXCmw-00004 we had law enforcement partners
rev4-yeVz0rtXCmw-00005 they need support
rev4-zL2FOrx41N0-00001 how does it happen
rev4-zMGE3mbS9NY-00001 at the same time
rev4-zuYzOn0U2PY-00001 it's a fucking orgy
rev4-zuYzOn0U2PY-00002 how is it made
rev4-zuYzOn0U2PY-00003 why was it made
rev4-zuYzOn0U2PY-00005 they feel at home
