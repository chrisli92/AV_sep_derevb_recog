rev1-6300370419826092098-00001 so we need you to help us in our revival campaign
rev1-6300370419826092098-00002 or into vodka and adding a bit of honey
rev1-6300370419826092098-00003 those should have rooted
rev1-6300370419826092098-00004 maybe in a greenhouse
rev1-6300370419826092098-00006 versatile plant with so many great uses
rev1-6300370419826092098-00007 i think they're an important part of our heritage and one that we should be proud to revive
rev1-6300370419826092098-00010 but the gardens have been swept away by later monarchs demonstrating later
rev1-6300370419826092098-00012 that's the point
rev1-6300370419826092098-00013 so they look radically different but their origins are actually from the same place
rev1-6300370419826092098-00014 what are the key practicalities
rev1-6300370419826092098-00016 they look fantastic
rev1-6300370419826092098-00018 which gives me a very instantly recognisable design
rev1-6300370419826092098-00020 crunchy lettuce but
rev1-6300370419826092098-00024 they're very low maintenance
rev1-6300370419826092098-00025 they offer year round structure and the design
rev1-6301320037095305408-00002 the gist of it is
rev1-6301320037095305408-00003 i'll have it all squared
rev1-6301320037095305408-00004 just when you think you're having the worst day possible
rev1-6301320037095305408-00006 that kit has to be here at 11 o'clock
rev1-6301320037095305408-00007 all those people want to take my picture
rev1-6301320037095305408-00009 if you don't go under again
rev1-6301320037095305408-00010 like i never do
rev1-6302978323968228875-00005 even if it's only a single one
rev1-6302978323968228875-00007 and for the customers
rev1-6302978323968228875-00008 don't bring tom
rev1-6302978323968228875-00010 why did you bring me in here
rev1-6302978323968228875-00011 whether you've got a window box
rev1-6302978323968228875-00012 whether you've got a hanging basket
rev1-6302978323968228875-00013 if you soak the flowers of this they've just come out the greenhouse you'll end up blemishing the
rev1-6302978323968228875-00015 without people like yourselves
rev1-6302978323968228875-00016 the pelargonium industry
rev1-6302978323968228875-00017 you've been sniffing those geranium leaves
rev1-6302978323968228875-00019 not just in the uk
rev1-6302978323968228875-00020 but in the world
rev1-6302978323968228875-00021 between four to six weeks' time and by the end of this season
rev1-6302978323968228875-00022 september or october
rev1-6302978323968228875-00023 very nice looking plant by early autumn and then you're multiplying your favourite
rev1-6303167732026041278-00001 the majestic kirby hall in northamptonshire
rev1-6303167732026041278-00004 also wanted the queen to come and stay at his house
rev1-6303167732026041278-00005 let's talk about them
rev1-6303167732026041278-00006 under the glass domes
rev1-6303167732026041278-00007 possibly even into the early part of the 20th century
rev1-6303167732026041278-00011 but was in need of some serious tlc
rev1-6303167732026041278-00013 i wasn't given it
rev1-6303167732026041278-00014 i was virtually given it
rev1-6303167732026041278-00017 there was no paint in the way that we understand it
rev1-6303167732026041278-00018 and single objects that are found in this way
rev1-6303167732026041278-00019 are very seldom viewed as treasure trove
rev1-6303167732026041278-00023 in its day it was home to sumptuous wealth and sir christopher hatton
rev1-6306811582279909115-00001 and it was once voted the most haunted house in britain
rev1-6306811582279909115-00003 more than 400 years later
rev1-6306811582279909115-00004 on the anniversary of her death
rev1-6306811582279909115-00005 it's said her headless ghost arrives here in a carriage driven by headless horses and a headless
rev1-6306811582279909115-00006 i'll be back here to find out what really goes on behind the closed doors of this beautiful and
rev1-6306811582279909115-00007 you might consider house hunting in norfolk
rev1-6306811582279909115-00009 making homes in this lovely county incredible value for those seeking a rural retreat
rev1-6306811582279909115-00010 which is great news for today's buyers
rev1-6306811582279909115-00011 we have the seaside
rev1-6306811582279909115-00012 you're both retired
rev1-6306811582279909115-00013 there are some converted barns
rev1-6306811582279909115-00014 and the same person that converted those built this house in the same style
rev1-6306811582279909115-00015 because nigel was so stern about the budget
rev1-6306811582279909115-00018 that's my whole life sorted
rev1-6306811582279909115-00019 and it really is all she ever talks about
rev1-6306811582279909115-00021 and then had it built
rev1-6306811582279909115-00022 i think it's a gorgeous place
rev1-6306811582279909115-00023 it was on the market for 450
rev1-6306811582279909115-00025 with the other homes
rev1-6306811582279909115-00026 we've tried to accommodate the family that they're going to be leaving behind
rev1-6306811582279909115-00027 but the mystery house
rev1-6306811582279909115-00030 the question is
rev1-6306811582279909115-00033 it really was the perfect home for them and the family
rev1-6306811582279909115-00034 it had everything they asked for
rev1-6306811582279909115-00035 and even though he needs some time
rev1-6306870852828565379-00002 in the fairy tales
rev1-6306870852828565379-00004 in making people think that they had a common german heritage to look back
rev1-6306870852828565379-00006 according to my guidebook
rev1-6306870852828565379-00007 occupations are chiefly with timber
rev1-6306870852828565379-00008 was heard in these valleys
rev1-6306870852828565379-00010 eastern railways were still advertising trips to germany and 6
rev1-6306870852828565379-00013 thoughts about the beauty of nature
rev1-6306870852828565379-00014 now it's surrounded by the skyscrapers of the modern city of frankfurt
rev1-6306870852828565379-00015 there were three stations before that
rev1-6306870852828565379-00016 i love to stay in a traditional hotel
rev1-6306870852828565379-00017 that's the impression many people have
rev1-6306870852828565379-00018 and the problem is people don't really understand that much about economics
rev1-6306870852828565379-00019 where he was born in 1749
rev1-6306870852828565379-00021 by your language
rev1-6306870852828565379-00022 i think without the burschenschaften
rev1-6306870852828565379-00023 for the first time in the world
rev1-6306870852828565379-00024 you're blowing air between these two points
rev1-6306870852828565379-00026 models of trains
rev1-6306870852828565379-00027 amongst the many german states that had been overrun by the french emperor napoleon and whose
rev1-6306870852828565379-00028 there arose the idea of creating a nation
rev1-6306870852828565379-00029 germany was a great power
rev1-6308177381880006979-00001 the writing garden which
rev1-6308177381880006979-00002 is mainly white
rev1-6308177381880006979-00004 but i do want to share and celebrate the animals that are enjoying it
rev1-6308177381880006979-00005 but the flowers are over now
rev1-6308177381880006979-00006 doesn't look good
rev1-6308177381880006979-00007 not much else is getting a benefit from it
rev1-6308177381880006979-00008 even though you can't see it
rev1-6308177381880006979-00010 but i think it can be done
rev1-6308177381880006979-00011 when you're planting for bees in particular
rev1-6308177381880006979-00012 but insects in general
rev1-6308177381880006979-00013 it's covering what i'm doing now
rev1-6308177381880006979-00017 so that should anything happen in one area where the plants were displayed
rev1-6308177381880006979-00022 but not until you've done these jobs for the weekend
rev1-6308177381880006979-00024 not least from the building and grounds
rev1-6308177381880006979-00026 i don't flood them every now and then and let them dry out
rev1-6308177381880006979-00027 grow them on and you'll be harvesting them in late september and october
rev1-6308177381880006979-00028 as the only female in a hard
rev1-6308312673349834578-00004 wombats are like little bulldozers
rev1-6308312673349834578-00008 this is the kangaroo bible
rev1-6308312673349834578-00010 i give him a teddy bear or a punching bag
rev1-6308312673349834578-00013 it's a good feeling
rev1-6309468449049188125-00004 it's gone from tired and old
rev1-6309468449049188125-00006 and he's old school
rev1-6309468449049188125-00007 and he's going to turn those battered old doors into something saleable
rev1-6309468449049188125-00016 chunky bits of timber
rev1-6309468449049188125-00017 and they are really rough and ready
rev1-6309468449049188125-00018 it's going to be a lot of work
rev1-6309468449049188125-00020 with a new baby on the way
rev1-6309468449049188125-00021 that 99 will definitely come in handy
rev1-6309468449049188125-00024 norman has made something really beautiful with those old scraps
rev1-6309468449049188125-00026 we've handed over a little bit of money along the way
rev1-6309824072341293478-00001 i'm ted and i'm studying to become a barrister
rev1-6309824072341293478-00002 very much we practised for it
rev1-6309824072341293478-00004 i don't know anything about ella eyre but on the basis that ellie goulding definitely had an album
rev1-6309824072341293478-00005 i guess i'll go for her
rev1-6309824072341293478-00007 i think it's a white cross on a blue background
rev1-6309824072341293478-00008 this is what we have been playing towards
rev1-6309824072341293478-00009 it is time for the final round
rev1-6309824072341293478-00010 i have read about him
rev1-6310166810731517953-00002 they talk a lot about the feel of natural energy in an arena
rev1-6310166810731517953-00005 as far as vienna at one time
rev1-6310166810731517953-00007 probably been at the heart of human affairs
rev1-6310166810731517953-00009 for new generation and new age
rev1-6310166810731517953-00011 i don't remember
rev1-6310166810731517953-00014 all of these troglodyte caves everywhere and the nice landscape
rev1-6310166810731517953-00015 many years later
rev1-6310166810731517953-00016 because it was empty
rev1-6310166810731517953-00017 when i was a little child
rev1-6310166810731517953-00025 so it's against islamic law
rev1-6310166810731517953-00026 i'm really not a good muslim person
rev1-6310195157515669986-00001 the show where a team of five quiz challengers pit their wits against possibly the greatest quiz
rev1-6310195157515669986-00002 i'm kim and i'm an ncs recruitment officer
rev1-6310195157515669986-00004 that was brilliant
rev1-6310195157515669986-00005 i'm katherine and i'm a mentoring coordinator
rev1-6310195157515669986-00006 so it's a round
rev1-6310195157515669986-00008 nothing at all is coming
rev1-6310195157515669986-00009 wouldn't it be nice to get on with me neighbours
rev1-6310195157515669986-00010 i can't even think of a sensible answer
rev1-6310195157515669986-00011 i do know it when i heard the answer
rev1-6310195157515669986-00012 i know the song
rev1-6310195157515669986-00014 but i thought 40
rev1-6310195157515669986-00015 it's time for the final round
rev1-6310195157515669986-00016 so on that basis
rev1-6310195157515669986-00017 so we're going to go with royal standard
rev1-6310968251628953184-00001 and they might not even make it through the first battle
rev1-6310968251628953184-00002 ladies and gentlemen
rev1-6310968251628953184-00010 it may not look anything like it does now
rev1-6310968251628953184-00011 or did to start the fight
rev1-6310968251628953184-00014 and had a look at what was remaining
rev1-6310968251628953184-00018 for the last time tonight
rev1-6311014637275749987-00001 sports is once again hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons
rev1-6311014637275749987-00002 you get them in the post
rev1-6311014637275749987-00003 with that much at stake
rev1-6311014637275749987-00007 and then the shame
rev1-6311014637275749987-00012 ask him what he's taking
rev1-6311014637275749987-00013 how he's taking them
rev1-6311014637275749987-00014 who's he get them off
rev1-6311014637275749987-00018 and then when i met natalie
rev1-6311014637275749987-00025 and there are people who will say
rev1-6311014637275749987-00026 he only got into that much trouble because he took too much
rev1-6311014637275749987-00027 but that definitely isn't true
rev1-6311014637275749987-00028 these are dangerous drugs
rev1-6311014637275749987-00029 they just want to look better
rev1-6311014637275749987-00030 male pattern baldness
rev1-6311014637275749987-00031 impaired erectile function
rev1-6311014637275749987-00032 and in about 10 of the cases
rev1-6311014637275749987-00033 the cells die prematurely
rev1-6311014637275749987-00034 the longer that you have been taking your steroids
rev1-6311014637275749987-00035 it would be very worrying
rev1-6311014637275749987-00036 because this would mean that men who take steroids over long periods of time might be at greater
rev1-6311014637275749987-00037 and that the vast majority of cigarette smokers were still under the age of 50 now
rev1-6311014637275749987-00038 in that scenario
rev1-6311014637275749987-00039 the occasional report of emphysema
rev1-6311014637275749987-00040 the heart in fact is the strongest muscle in the body
rev1-6311014637275749987-00041 and it's the only muscle that never rests
rev1-6311014637275749987-00043 they have not gone through clinical trials
rev1-6311014637275749987-00044 and yet their use does not exist in the shadows
rev1-6311014637275749987-00046 but these new molecules have never been approved for human use
rev1-6311014637275749987-00047 it's not a big statistical trial
rev1-6311014637275749987-00048 i think because i
rev1-6311014637275749987-00049 like everyone else
rev1-6311014637275749987-00050 would like to look a bit better and would like a magic injection to do it
rev1-6311014637275749987-00051 but this is not the way
rev1-6311014637275749987-00052 these are dangerous drugs
rev1-6311014637275749987-00053 you're on all these dosages
rev1-6311014637275749987-00054 how do you feel
rev1-6311014637275749987-00055 that i've got a tummy
rev1-6311014637275749987-00056 which means that they have to tell us where they're available to be tested every single day of the
rev1-6311014637275749987-00057 and i was immediately
rev1-6311014637275749987-00058 the day that paper came out
rev1-6311014637275749987-00060 i had no idea that was coming
rev1-6311014637275749987-00063 and at that point
rev1-6311014637275749987-00064 if you're anything like me
rev1-6311014637275749987-00066 i've roped in my identical twin brother
rev1-6311014637275749987-00068 so what were going to be doing is passing a very mild electrical current over an area of the brain
rev1-6311014637275749987-00069 maybe a slight burning
rev1-6311280066254641716-00006 is covered with paintings
rev1-6311280066254641716-00010 trying to find direction
rev1-6311280066254641716-00013 how much has romania changed
rev1-6311651151429016127-00001 there was one house on this grand and elegant street where you never wanted to end up
rev1-6311651151429016127-00003 but you also have to remember the location of hungary
rev1-6311651151429016127-00004 where we are located
rev1-6311651151429016127-00014 much more independent
rev1-6311651151429016127-00015 this is the levadia palace
rev1-6311651151429016127-00018 and many of them have positive
rev1-6311651151429016127-00019 nice memories of the soviet days
rev1-6312022236603390541-00004 and they think that tradition's not necessary
rev1-6312022236603390541-00008 because this is
rev1-6312022236603390541-00009 so it was very exciting
rev1-6312022236603390541-00010 that's for our president
rev1-6312022236603390541-00012 as well as russian academy of science
rev1-6312066045269810824-00004 met irving while he was in new york city
rev1-6312066045269810824-00006 they raised their glasses and the toast was
rev1-6312066045269810824-00007 down with the train
rev1-6312066045269810824-00008 and a whole budget of others
rev1-6312066045269810824-00010 as any cadet at the academy could tell you
rev1-6312066045269810824-00012 is one of the most attractive places on the river and the seat of the national military academy
rev1-6312066045269810824-00015 without a doubt
rev1-6312066045269810824-00016 it came close to almost destroying this nation
rev1-6312066045269810824-00017 31 years on active duty as a colonel
rev1-6312066045269810824-00021 having come to know a little bit about this mighty river
rev1-6312066045269810824-00022 i personally would always choose a railway line
rev1-6312066045269810824-00023 going back to that to try to form a stronger american identity when so many things are being
rev1-6312066045269810824-00026 new york made a statement
rev1-6312066045269810824-00027 it will be the largest and most splendid edifice in america
rev1-6312066045269810824-00028 we're a lot different than other states in terms of our philosophy
rev1-6313565847849574520-00003 50 of the robots gone at the very
rev1-6313565847849574520-00006 and we will follow them
rev1-6313565847849574520-00013 for the last time tonight
rev1-6313656042293295351-00001 my father went to west africa
rev1-6313656042293295351-00003 i'd never seen a black man
rev1-6313656042293295351-00004 to the best of my recollection
rev1-6313656042293295351-00007 and the medical officer might have been your father
rev1-6313656042293295351-00008 it might have been on its own in europe
rev1-6313656042293295351-00009 but it had a vast empire
rev1-6313656042293295351-00012 in the deepest jungle
rev1-6313656042293295351-00014 they've been likened to the battle of stalingrad and the battle of el alamein and midway as
rev1-6313656042293295351-00016 saw that it no longer had the strategic value it had
rev1-6313656042293295351-00018 those fatal shots
rev1-6313877662475262663-00001 things didn't really get much better
rev1-6313877662475262663-00005 they know of python
rev1-6313877662475262663-00012 we're building a house now in the forest
rev1-6313877662475262663-00013 which is coming on very nicely
rev1-6313877662475262663-00015 and we have a lovely daughter whose name actually by the way is chelsea
rev1-6313877662475262663-00016 that's the best that i could ever wish them
rev1-6313877662475262663-00017 i think i can see where you're coming from asking that question
rev1-6313877662475262663-00018 as a brave nation that however has something to offer here and now
rev1-6313877662475262663-00028 what about your love life here
rev1-6313877662475262663-00030 this is a scheduled service
rev1-6313877662475262663-00033 i've great respect for these guys
rev1-6313877662475262663-00034 but it was a great run
rev1-6313877662475262663-00039 and it's really hard physical work
rev1-6313936933024013236-00002 exercise is a waste of time
rev1-6313936933024013236-00004 congratulations about the baby
rev1-6313936933024013236-00006 i was all right in the end
rev1-6313936933024013236-00008 it was a one off
rev1-6313936933024013236-00009 it was a one off
rev1-6313936933024013236-00011 but you have to understand
rev1-6313936933024013236-00014 and phil wouldn't tell me anything
rev1-6314248747649637090-00002 000 foot mountain range in the heart of europe
rev1-6314248747649637090-00003 but these are the high tatras
rev1-6314248747649637090-00004 part of the carpathian range
rev1-6314248747649637090-00009 i think czechs are very social
rev1-6314248747649637090-00013 i guess it was a larger community
rev1-6314248747649637090-00014 not everything was wrong
rev1-6314248747649637090-00015 some people still have the wall in their heads
rev1-6314248747649637090-00017 what people plan
rev1-6314248747649637090-00018 so what was shocking for him was the result
rev1-6314308018198387664-00001 and i may be no action woman
rev1-6314308018198387664-00002 you may find him
rev1-6314308018198387664-00005 are you eating properly
rev1-6314308018198387664-00006 and if he improves
rev1-6314308018198387664-00007 i want to isolate a patient from exposure to the wi fi
rev1-6314308018198387664-00008 if your symptoms fade while you're in here
rev1-6314308018198387664-00009 we're looking back at how sport and music came together in the 80s to create some amazing and some
rev1-6314619832824012968-00002 the portuguese who followed him found indigenous people here
rev1-6314619832824012968-00004 cotton and tobacco that they set up
rev1-6314619832824012968-00007 but it's low tide
rev1-6314619832824012968-00010 this is very powerful
rev1-6314619832824012968-00011 so i might find out something very unpleasant
rev1-6314619832824012968-00012 because i'm going to something
rev1-6314619832824012968-00015 you have to run
rev1-6314990917998387385-00003 there's no road access at all
rev1-6314990917998387385-00004 i'm heading south now
rev1-6314990917998387385-00006 in brazil as well
rev1-6314990917998387385-00007 still we're very
rev1-6315050188547072188-00003 before the railways
rev1-6315050188547072188-00011 the railway lines could then ship it back to the ports
rev1-6315050188547072188-00014 it's a really good
rev1-6315405811839181004-00002 lots of outlying farms and a small collection of buildings
rev1-6315405811839181004-00003 thousands of tonnes of ammunition
rev1-6315405811839181004-00004 so his troops were very hungry
rev1-6315405811839181004-00005 so they ate what they could and
rev1-6315405811839181004-00006 whatever they couldn't carry off
rev1-6315405811839181004-00007 the confederate commander
rev1-6315405811839181004-00008 a lot of people consider that one of his greatest victories because he drove the union army from
rev1-6315405811839181004-00009 but i think it's important that when we look back on that and take a certain pride in that that we
rev1-6315405811839181004-00010 it was founded in 1727 and contains about 6
rev1-6315405811839181004-00011 an ideal place for me to begin to discover the spirit of the
rev1-6315405811839181004-00012 when i'm going to sit down in the evening with a nice glass of bourbon
rev1-6315405811839181004-00018 wondering if they're doing it correctly
rev1-6315405811839181004-00019 we didn't see any of that with you
rev1-6315405811839181004-00021 after two months of active debating
rev1-6315405811839181004-00022 88 voted to secede
rev1-6315405811839181004-00023 i feel much that makes me feel at home
rev1-6315405811839181004-00026 what was that saying
rev1-6315405811839181004-00027 that was saying that
rev1-6315405811839181004-00029 tell me about that
rev1-6315405811839181004-00031 it wasn't even close to the uss monitor
rev1-6315405811839181004-00033 only one turret
rev1-6315405811839181004-00034 virtually every major combat vessel that was designed
rev1-6315405811839181004-00035 not only the american navy
rev1-6315405811839181004-00036 but in navy's around the world after the battle of hampton roads
rev1-6315405811839181004-00037 they were new vessels
rev1-6315405811839181004-00041 during the revolution
rev1-6315405811839181004-00042 we see ourselves as something else
rev1-6315405811839181004-00043 later in their history
rev1-6315405811839181004-00044 they didn't much like being told by yankees that they shouldn't own slaves
rev1-6315405811839181004-00045 to use the term
rev1-6315405811839181004-00046 you know that doesn't go very well
rev1-6315405811839181004-00047 when john smith returns to england 1609
rev1-6315405811839181004-00049 and that never works out well
rev1-6315405811839181004-00050 that there are great chunks of virginian history that i did not know
rev1-6315405811839181004-00051 it's kind of overshadowed by massachusetts
rev1-6315405811839181004-00052 after the south lost the war in our civil war
rev1-6315405811839181004-00053 where the indians and the pilgrims sat down together
rev1-6315421273721446605-00002 to get through to the next stage
rev1-6315421273721446605-00003 do go to our website
rev1-6315421273721446605-00006 thanks for watching
rev1-6316024287129869379-00001 more and more people would love to have their own property portfolio
rev1-6316024287129869379-00002 then at least you'd have your foot on the property developing ladder
rev1-6316024287129869379-00003 i've never seen a house like this
rev1-6316024287129869379-00007 it sort of works
rev1-6316024287129869379-00010 made in a local factory
rev1-6316024287129869379-00011 the minton factory
rev1-6316024287129869379-00012 but you've got to be very
rev1-6316024287129869379-00013 we looked at a load of houses in the university area
rev1-6316024287129869379-00014 i work part time
rev1-6316024287129869379-00016 they seem to be as sad as i will be to see this floor in the back go
rev1-6316024287129869379-00017 but they mean noise and traffic
rev1-6316024287129869379-00018 the road itself is attractive
rev1-6316024287129869379-00023 that is what lets this flat down
rev1-6316024287129869379-00024 i'd expect to get 1
rev1-6316024287129869379-00027 long gap with trying to sort out the paperwork
rev1-6316024287129869379-00028 i don't think john will have the same problem here
rev1-6316024287129869379-00029 where will john decide he wants the wet room
rev1-6316024287129869379-00030 will their friendship survive this tooting transformation
rev1-6316024287129869379-00032 i wasn't having it
rev1-6316024287129869379-00035 about quarter of a mile from the metro station
rev1-6316024287129869379-00038 so added to all the other things you're going to do to this property
rev1-6316024287129869379-00040 the overall size of it
rev1-6316024287129869379-00042 i'm sure it generated a lot of interest when it went under the hammer
rev1-6316024287129869379-00045 if this is a business
rev1-6316024287129869379-00047 time has passed
rev1-6316024287129869379-00048 paul and andy have got themselves a great property here
rev1-6316024287129869379-00049 and they're making the slight error of not costing in their own time and effort which
rev1-6316163444070195447-00001 they're both still working right now
rev1-6316163444070195447-00007 he's driving well
rev1-6316163444070195447-00008 it's normally something simple
rev1-6318761040290818803-00009 so we're really happy that we got to do that
rev1-6318761040290818803-00012 the flipper was only firing at half power in the last fight
rev1-6318761040290818803-00013 as well as being cold
rev1-6318761040290818803-00019 not just robots
rev1-6318761040290818803-00021 we couldn't have imagined ten
rev1-6318761040290818803-00022 and the price of sensors
rev1-6318761040290818803-00023 and even the house robots aren't safe
rev1-6318761040290818803-00024 for the final time tonight
rev1-6318761040290818803-00026 that's what we do
rev1-6321358636511442057-00002 used it very intelligently
rev1-6321358636511442057-00003 by running away
rev1-6321358636511442057-00004 getting it up to speed and making the attack at the right precise moment
rev1-6321358636511442057-00005 you might have a really nice well engineered machine
rev1-6321358636511442057-00006 ready for the next battle
rev1-6321358636511442057-00008 it was not a knockout
rev1-6321358636511442057-00010 the gas system was misbehaving
rev1-6321358636511442057-00015 even though it lasted the whole three minutes
rev1-6321358636511442057-00017 but who will win
rev1-6322100806860254619-00006 i give you guy self
rev1-6322100806860254619-00008 even when it wasn't his fault
rev1-6322100806860254619-00009 family of my own
rev1-6323198600501050831-00003 it's freezing cold
rev1-6323198600501050831-00006 just loved the lifestyle
rev1-6323198600501050831-00007 working these antisocial hours
rev1-6323198600501050831-00008 there is some health risk
rev1-6323198600501050831-00013 the final test for our final four
rev1-6323198600501050831-00016 and make no mistake
rev1-6323198600501050831-00017 as long as you have got the right training to do the job
rev1-6323198600501050831-00018 you've got the right tools to do the job
rev1-6323198600501050831-00019 you know exactly what's being monitored and why and you know how you can influence that
rev1-6323198600501050831-00020 they might suffer from low self esteem
rev1-6323198600501050831-00022 it's interesting that
rev1-6323198600501050831-00023 when you make monitoring more intense
rev1-6323198600501050831-00024 i don't think we are
rev1-6323198600501050831-00025 and if we want a prosperous
rev1-6323198600501050831-00027 and often in sort of a capacity of care
rev1-6323198600501050831-00029 new jobs do arise
rev1-6323198600501050831-00030 new jobs are created
rev1-6323198600501050831-00032 i think i could live on the minimum wage
rev1-6323198600501050831-00033 that was two reasons
rev1-6323198600501050831-00037 all i've known is farming
rev1-6323221793324446979-00001 look at other gardens
rev1-6323221793324446979-00002 planted in winter
rev1-6323221793324446979-00004 and after last summer's disaster with my grapes
rev1-6323221793324446979-00005 what with wasps and blackbirds
rev1-6323221793324446979-00007 you can simply cut the whole lot flush with the ground round about christmas time and let it start
rev1-6323221793324446979-00008 because there is an element of skill involved
rev1-6323221793324446979-00011 produce their fruit on this year's canes
rev1-6323221793324446979-00012 so it is a job to do
rev1-6323221793324446979-00013 because you don't want more than four or five canes per plant
rev1-6323221793324446979-00015 and so probably my grandfather
rev1-6323221793324446979-00016 who was brought up there
rev1-6323221793324446979-00017 from the same canes
rev1-6323221793324446979-00018 a few years ago
rev1-6323221793324446979-00022 because we think jekyll did it all remotely
rev1-6323221793324446979-00025 and then as autumn comes and it goes
rev1-6323221793324446979-00026 the broccoli can take over the whole space
rev1-6323221793324446979-00028 and by the end of the season it's right up here
rev1-6323221793324446979-00029 and on top of that
rev1-6323221793324446979-00032 i grow vegetables because i like the taste
rev1-6323221793324446979-00035 comparing the two different locations with same varieties
rev1-6323221793324446979-00039 this is hundreds and thousands
rev1-6323221793324446979-00041 so please put any pictures you can on our facebook page
rev1-6323221793324446979-00042 but you've got a bank holiday weekend coming up
rev1-6323221793324446979-00043 so extra time to do extra jobs in the garden
rev1-6323221793324446979-00044 great wasps' nest
rev1-6323221793324446979-00045 which means you stay away
rev1-6323221793324446979-00048 and good flavour this year
rev1-6323817075791736335-00002 will they sink or swim
rev1-6323817075791736335-00010 depending on the age
rev1-6323817075791736335-00013 it's all over the walls
rev1-6323817075791736335-00015 will it have too much of a stigma attached to it
rev1-6323817075791736335-00020 talk me through the two options
rev1-6323817075791736335-00024 i've got the monies in place
rev1-6323817075791736335-00026 he's got the money to complete on the purchase
rev1-6323817075791736335-00028 will he get the planning permission
rev1-6323817075791736335-00029 will he get it sorted out
rev1-6323817075791736335-00030 you can find out later in the show
rev1-6323817075791736335-00032 although in this case
rev1-6323817075791736335-00033 if you're intent on recouping the cash and pocketing the profit
rev1-6323817075791736335-00034 you may very well end up disappointed
rev1-6323817075791736335-00038 this house is probably worth around 120
rev1-6323817075791736335-00041 on paper and in theory
rev1-6323817075791736335-00042 the problem that you're likely to face is actually selling the thing
rev1-6323817075791736335-00046 then you can tell me to shut up
rev1-6323817075791736335-00049 that's fair enough
rev1-6323817075791736335-00050 you have got a great work ethic and
rev1-6323817075791736335-00051 any profit is a profit
rev1-6323817075791736335-00053 some profit is much
rev1-6323817075791736335-00054 much better than none
rev1-6323817075791736335-00055 i'm also pleased he'll consider renting
rev1-6323817075791736335-00056 i just hope whoever bought it was prepared to keep hold
rev1-6323817075791736335-00057 000 on this property
rev1-6323817075791736335-00063 so it would be more sought after
rev1-6323817075791736335-00064 i was expecting around the 70
rev1-6323817075791736335-00065 i have spent a lot of money on these flats
rev1-6323817075791736335-00066 get me money back in the pot
rev1-6323817075791736335-00067 and it gets better
rev1-6323817075791736335-00072 especially the ground floor
rev1-6323817075791736335-00073 whether they be sold or let
rev1-6323817075791736335-00074 it has been done to a high standard
rev1-6323817075791736335-00075 especially for first time buyers
rev1-6323817075791736335-00085 but there's still planning issues to resolve and will he be able to sell the properties
rev1-6323817075791736335-00101 i would suggest that he rents each property out at between 500 and
rev1-6323817075791736335-00106 in order to achieve that
rev1-6323956232732063947-00005 it's a tough fight
rev1-6323956232732063947-00011 all of the robots out there full of energy
rev1-6323956232732063947-00013 we could have flipped them at one point
rev1-6323956232732063947-00017 we can still do it
rev1-6323956232732063947-00019 it healed its scars
rev1-6323956232732063947-00020 this is the final i would have asked for
rev1-6323956232732063947-00022 the teams are ready
rev1-6323956232732063947-00023 for the last time this series
rev1-6323956232732126743-00002 the people of tewkesbury
rev1-6323956232732126743-00003 that came to 483
rev1-6323956232732126743-00004 within two years
rev1-6323956232732126743-00005 and has been turned into a bangle
rev1-6323956232732126743-00006 which in many ways is very wearable
rev1-6323956232732126743-00007 which is not particularly bad news
rev1-6323956232732126743-00008 which is beautiful
rev1-6323956232732126743-00009 that is the designer
rev1-6323956232732126743-00010 but then here on this side
rev1-6323956232732126743-00012 it's after galle's death
rev1-6323956232732126743-00013 but it's still a stunning thing
rev1-6323956232732126743-00014 they are holding that
rev1-6323956232732126743-00016 and i saw this in an auction in australia
rev1-6323956232732126743-00017 they've been in england
rev1-6323956232732126743-00018 there was the father of ornithology
rev1-6323956232732126743-00019 so it was a process partly of print
rev1-6323956232732126743-00020 and if we turn this one round
rev1-6323956232732126743-00024 which was designed in 1900
rev1-6323956232732126743-00025 they were there for espionage
rev1-6323956232732126743-00027 my parents had it before i was born
rev1-6323956232732126743-00028 i was brought up with it
rev1-6323956232732126743-00029 and it is just so remarkably stylish
rev1-6323956232732126743-00030 just look at it
rev1-6323956232732126743-00032 like never before
rev1-6323956232732126743-00034 it's been great
rev1-6324230681142278360-00002 who lurches from one state hand out to the next
rev1-6324230681142278360-00006 there's no doubt about it
rev1-6324230681142278360-00007 this is all very promising
rev1-6324230681142278360-00009 i can't say i do
rev1-6324230681142278360-00010 apart from anything else
rev1-6324230681142278360-00013 i was just thinking what an eventful day it's been
rev1-6324230681142278360-00016 we could be very happy together
rev1-6324698403080812792-00002 how waterproof they are
rev1-6324698403080812792-00005 they share a lot of the same design and technology as high performance running shoes
rev1-6324698403080812792-00010 i'm doing ok here
rev1-6324698403080812792-00011 and you send that to the factory
rev1-6324698403080812792-00013 was broken in the 1850s when the industrial revolution came to
rev1-6324698403080812792-00014 so shoes today could end up in a high street in workington down the road
rev1-6324698403080812792-00015 or fifth avenue
rev1-6324698403080812792-00016 i loved that they were really pretty and delicate
rev1-6324698403080812792-00017 how do they make them
rev1-6324698403080812792-00021 what does it like
rev1-6324698403080812792-00022 in the afternoon
rev1-6324698403080812792-00023 you might get one size
rev1-6324698403080812792-00024 you'll buy a perfect shoe that fits
rev1-6324698403080812792-00027 somewhere in the world
rev1-6324698403080875597-00006 helping all those people
rev1-6324698403080875597-00007 don't worry about it
rev1-6324713864963081921-00001 it dwarfs anything we have in britain
rev1-6324713864963081921-00006 the reason travelling seems so seamless is because of all the efforts that go on behind the scenes
rev1-6324713864963081921-00008 in 70 million square feet of office space
rev1-6324713864963081921-00011 they've just completed the main stage of construction
rev1-6324713864963081921-00013 some items are held for three months
rev1-6324713864963081921-00014 we're running about 1
rev1-6324713864963081921-00015 200 people all day
rev1-6324713864963081921-00016 and then at our season
rev1-6324713864963081921-00017 which is between thanksgiving and christmas
rev1-6324713864963081921-00019 when things are good
rev1-6324713864963081921-00021 at the end of the day
rev1-6324713864963081921-00024 it depends on the drivers
rev1-6324713864963081921-00026 mighty oaks will grow
rev1-6324764116080445123-00001 he still had a chance of not surviving this injury
rev1-6324764116080445123-00004 even if we restart the heart
rev1-6324764116080445123-00005 but from the ecg changes and looking at david
rev1-6324764116080445123-00006 he's got chest pain
rev1-6324764116080445123-00007 it is the giving of an anaesthetic drug and a paralytic
rev1-6324764116080445123-00008 because his heart is still struggling to work
rev1-6324764116080445123-00010 every bump is caused by something else
rev1-6324764116080445123-00011 and you need to piece together all those bits
rev1-6324764116080445123-00012 at the base of the brain
rev1-6324764116080445123-00013 pushing the spinal cord across
rev1-6324764116080445123-00014 then it will be damaging the cord
rev1-6324764116080445123-00017 from that point
rev1-6324764116080445123-00018 if you press enough on that
rev1-6324764116080445123-00019 if you act quickly enough
rev1-6324764116080445123-00020 pulled him out and done exactly the same thing
rev1-6325119739372550419-00005 they share a lot of the same design and technology as high performance running shoes
rev1-6325119739372550419-00014 was broken in the 1850s when the industrial revolution came to
rev1-6325119739372550419-00015 or fifth avenue
rev1-6325119739372550419-00016 i loved that they were really pretty and delicate
rev1-6325119739372550419-00017 how do they make them
rev1-6325119739372550419-00021 what does it like
rev1-6325119739372550419-00022 in the afternoon
rev1-6325119739372550419-00023 you might get one size
rev1-6325119739372550419-00024 you'll buy a perfect shoe that fits
rev1-6325119739372550419-00026 my shoes are behind there
rev1-6325119739372550419-00027 somewhere in the world
rev1-6325440573560032726-00001 on there as well
rev1-6325440573560032726-00002 that is incredible
rev1-6325440573560032726-00003 i think it was even more of a momentous event
rev1-6325440573560032726-00005 people with no money at all
rev1-6325440573560032726-00006 or next to no money
rev1-6325440573560032726-00007 when you came into contact with the state
rev1-6325440573560032726-00008 the post office apart
rev1-6325440573560032726-00009 right up to the 20th century
rev1-6325440573560032726-00011 or tell you what to do
rev1-6325440573560032726-00012 or take some of your money or all these kinds of things
rev1-6325440573560032726-00015 so all these dozens
rev1-6325440573560032726-00016 this is what will benefit
rev1-6325440573560032726-00018 so we work in tandem with each other because they come in obviously to post their parcels
rev1-6325440573560032726-00021 but you remember the old days in the post office
rev1-6325440573560032726-00022 this used to be called the post office's best kept secret
rev1-6325440573560032726-00025 so they can come down
rev1-6325440573560032726-00026 cos i had the heaviest delivery in europe
rev1-6325440573560032726-00027 so each one 40 pounds
rev1-6325440573560032726-00028 the post office
rev1-6325440573560032726-00029 it's a wonderful
rev1-6325440573560032726-00030 but it's backward looking
rev1-6325440573560032726-00031 i want to meet all of the director generals and i want to hear about what they do
rev1-6325440573560032726-00032 so he was restless
rev1-6325440573560032726-00034 do you want to come with me
rev1-6325440573560032726-00035 and we went to trafalgar square and
rev1-6325440573560032726-00036 if he hadn't been postmaster general
rev1-6325440573560032726-00038 wilson had talked in 63 about the white heat of technology and dad was
rev1-6325456035311830751-00002 mexico doesn't generate all that much good press overseas
rev1-6325456035311830751-00005 but i suppose some of my children will become prime minister instead
rev1-6325456035311830751-00006 by all reckoning
rev1-6325456035311830751-00007 it's not even a joke
rev1-6325456035311830751-00013 it's not the door
rev1-6325456035311830751-00017 any slaughterhouse is a lot worse i guess than what we're seeing here
rev1-6325796196721673967-00005 because they add that nice bit of structure
rev1-6325796196721673967-00007 hopefully over time
rev1-6325796196721673967-00009 this is perfect for taking advantage of vertical space like a boundary
rev1-6325796196721673967-00010 these are beautiful
rev1-6325796196721673967-00011 using meadow turf
rev1-6325819389545137915-00001 when i was a child
rev1-6325819389545137915-00002 the only thing that would get me to sleep was my parents reading me the takeaway menu from our
rev1-6325819389545137915-00003 something like that
rev1-6325819389545137915-00004 i don't think she's
rev1-6325819389545137915-00005 at the age of seven
rev1-6325819389545137915-00008 i want you to come to my bedroom
rev1-6325819389545137915-00010 my name is carlos
rev1-6325819389545137915-00011 and the bull's eyes
rev1-6325819389545137915-00012 they say you to be at least a minimum standard
rev1-6325819389545137915-00013 and to prove it
rev1-6325894121976022773-00003 i generally feel safe
rev1-6325894121976022773-00004 you need a bike that's convenient
rev1-6325894121976022773-00005 suddenly appears when you want it
rev1-6325894121976022773-00006 disappears when you don't want it
rev1-6325894121976022773-00008 but that's nothing compared to the price of some of the racing bikes
rev1-6325894121976022773-00009 they can cost up to 10
rev1-6325894121976022773-00010 but you don't have to spend a lot of money to pedal faster
rev1-6325894121976022773-00011 other tyres on other bikes
rev1-6325894121976022773-00013 when you order a bike from this factory
rev1-6325894121976022773-00014 you get a standard saddle but if you really want luxury for your bottom
rev1-6325894121976022773-00016 to make sure it's all right
rev1-6326360555424366722-00003 autumn coming in
rev1-6326360555424366722-00004 where it'll be fine as long as it's in water
rev1-6326360555424366722-00006 and i have got the effect i want
rev1-6326360555424366722-00007 and over the next four weeks
rev1-6326360555424366722-00008 dna testing allows us to identify exactly which group a plant belongs to
rev1-6326360555424366722-00009 but very few are
rev1-6326360555424366722-00012 with an odd sprinkling of annuals
rev1-6326360555424366722-00013 and one of the things that i like to do first
rev1-6326360555424366722-00014 and that keeps them dry
rev1-6326360555424366722-00016 not least cos the ground is often very hard
rev1-6326360555424366722-00017 because you can create the right conditions for it in the pot
rev1-6326360555424366722-00018 it also means if you don't have a garden
rev1-6326360555424366722-00019 you can have a fabulous spring display
rev1-6326360555424366722-00020 like goat droppings
rev1-6326360555424366722-00021 these have been in here for a couple of hours
rev1-6326360555424366722-00022 overnight is perfect
rev1-6326360555424366722-00024 and that's because
rev1-6326360555424366722-00025 like many neighbourhoods around the country
rev1-6326360555424366722-00026 it's had its difficulties
rev1-6326360555424366722-00028 the chance of me experiencing jungle is not very high
rev1-6326360555424366722-00029 i'm able to create
rev1-6326360555424366722-00030 tropical and unusual
rev1-6326360555424366722-00034 i thought that was something i really had to go and see
rev1-6326360555424366722-00037 i always made a beeline for decimus burton's palm house
rev1-6326360555424366722-00038 much better effect
rev1-6326360555424366722-00039 seven or nine stems
rev1-6326360555424366722-00040 no more than that
rev1-6326360555424366722-00041 and that will give you better flower spikes
rev1-6326360555424366722-00042 this main spike will lean over and split the crown at the bottom
rev1-6326360555424366722-00043 it could have as much as 30 or 40 little stems
rev1-6326360555424366722-00044 they're potential flowers
rev1-6326360555424366722-00045 because they're lovely plants
rev1-6326360555424366722-00047 they will always give you pleasure
rev1-6326360555424366722-00048 and they're tough
rev1-6326360555424366722-00050 it's wet and it's cold in winter
rev1-6326360555424366722-00051 they will last the winter they are hardy
rev1-6326360555424366722-00052 after all and then they've got a head start and will grow away next spring
rev1-6326360555424366722-00054 he has won many gold medals from chelsea and is a very
rev1-6326414672012357313-00001 view your property
rev1-6326414672012357313-00002 did today's buyers do their homework
rev1-6326414672012357313-00004 so much work needs to be done
rev1-6326414672012357313-00005 it certainly needs a lot of renovation
rev1-6326414672012357313-00006 everything needs doing
rev1-6326414672012357313-00011 you want to go to a certain level
rev1-6326414672012357313-00013 and it will still suit the needs and the requirements of that family
rev1-6326414672012357313-00014 so in that sense
rev1-6326414672012357313-00015 because you have to take this house back to the bare brick
rev1-6326414672012357313-00016 that's a relatively small budget
rev1-6326414672012357313-00017 the builders we use here in margate were originally a family we housed in london who came from very
rev1-6326414672012357313-00018 who ends up getting the house and how well it's done
rev1-6326414672012357313-00019 michael has a team of builders all ready to go
rev1-6326414672012357313-00021 but if you're not scared off by the state of the place and you pay near the guide price
rev1-6326414672012357313-00022 he's got a tenant already lined up waiting to move in
rev1-6326414672012357313-00023 will things run to plan
rev1-6326414672012357313-00024 will they stick to their budget
rev1-6326414672012357313-00025 there could be some room for some profit here
rev1-6326414672012357313-00028 anybody else can join in
rev1-6326414672012357313-00030 third and final time
rev1-6326414672012357313-00031 that's just one of the things in the grounds
rev1-6326414672012357313-00035 right by the side
rev1-6326414672012357313-00037 what can you do about it
rev1-6326414672012357313-00040 this area of cornwall
rev1-6326414672012357313-00041 famous for its mining in the past
rev1-6326414672012357313-00042 it's got three reception rooms
rev1-6326414672012357313-00043 six seven bedrooms upstairs
rev1-6326414672012357313-00044 it should sell in the region of 450
rev1-6326414672012357313-00046 if you were to build
rev1-6326414672012357313-00047 so even if there was a collapse situation
rev1-6326414672012357313-00049 how are they going to get on
rev1-6326414672012357313-00051 there is the development potential on the plot
rev1-6326414672012357313-00052 on the negative side
rev1-6326414672012357313-00053 a normal rabbit
rev1-6326414672012357313-00056 other than that
rev1-6326414672012357313-00058 it's really nice
rev1-6326414672012357313-00060 you never know quite what to bid to
rev1-6326414672012357313-00061 but now that the work's been done
rev1-6326414672012357313-00062 about three and a half miles from the nearest town of belper
rev1-6326414672012357313-00064 and before that
rev1-6326414672012357313-00066 and i think for that 80
rev1-6326414672012357313-00069 it won't appeal to everybody
rev1-6326414672012357313-00072 so not a good start
rev1-6326414672012357313-00073 so move into while i'm doing the work
rev1-6326414672012357313-00074 nice windows with a view out the front
rev1-6326414672012357313-00075 cos i'm home based
rev1-6326414672012357313-00080 you can find out later in the show
rev1-6326414672012357313-00083 did today's buyers finish their projects or was time their enemy
rev1-6326414672012357313-00085 we would look to market the property at an asking price in the region of 385
rev1-6326414672012357313-00086 it was a bit tired
rev1-6326414672012357313-00087 i think it's beautifully presented
rev1-6326414672012357313-00089 000 mark with a view to returning about 160
rev1-6326461057659161695-00005 but this family are spending so much
rev1-6326461057659161695-00008 she knows that she can't get to the paralympics
rev1-6326461057659161695-00009 train like that
rev1-6326461057659161695-00010 and eat stuff out of pots that you pour boiling water over
rev1-6326461057659161695-00011 thank you very much
rev1-6326461057659161695-00013 that tastes really clean and fresh
rev1-6326461057659161695-00015 after five years
rev1-6326461057659161695-00016 being catered for
rev1-6326461057659161695-00018 we set you a target of 3
rev1-6326461057659161695-00019 big fan of the brands and convenience food
rev1-6326538367070482119-00001 are we being duped
rev1-6326538367070482119-00002 until about three on one occasion
rev1-6326538367070482119-00004 and it is enormous
rev1-6326553828952690654-00001 i have long been an earnest advocate of closer ties between our two countries
rev1-6326553828952690654-00002 we will receive on united states soil
rev1-6326553828952690654-00003 we should pursue this strategy
rev1-6326553828952690654-00006 if entrusted to our navies
rev1-6326553828952690654-00007 as much information as your acts would allow us to have in advance of you getting the weapon into
rev1-6326553828952690654-00011 they don't want it
rev1-6326553828952690654-00012 the police tactics
rev1-6326553828952690654-00015 into one particular programme
rev1-6326553828952690654-00016 which is always dangerous for any politician
rev1-6326553828952690654-00017 5 billion into it already
rev1-6326553828952690654-00018 what is really meant by the words
rev1-6326553828952690654-00020 the uk wants a nuclear force
rev1-6326553828952690654-00023 if you're not prepared to provide us with polaris
rev1-6326866932068565154-00001 life expectancy could be as low as 40 years
rev1-6326866932068565154-00002 original ideas and i'm sorry
rev1-6326866932068565154-00005 they should be able to rise to the challenge and show us they can work with a raw material and make
rev1-6326866932068565154-00008 and men were encouraged to keep fit
rev1-6326866932068565154-00012 because this is all about being eclectic
rev1-6326866932068565154-00015 if a homeowner asks for contemporary
rev1-6326866932068565154-00016 i want to see that she can deliver that
rev1-6326990627126693682-00003 what we're looking for is whipped
rev1-6326990627126693682-00004 and that's part of the problem
rev1-6326990627126693682-00005 when it is simple
rev1-6326990627126693682-00006 i'm a pretty skilled baker
rev1-6327199362537275576-00005 and lighting your way to the future
rev1-6327199362537275576-00007 i'm happy to say
rev1-6327199362537275576-00008 but your candlestick was an enormous success
rev1-6327199362537275576-00017 but you were right to call me
rev1-6327295999301439627-00001 95 of people do
rev1-6327295999301439627-00005 if you don't do it
rev1-6327295999301439627-00009 you've got that wonderful sage
rev1-6327295999301439627-00011 it's not somewhere out of harry potter
rev1-6327295999301439627-00012 it's just up the road from kingy's house
rev1-6327295999301439627-00014 and a visit is well worth it
rev1-6327295999301439627-00018 like a language
rev1-6327295999301499598-00001 i wouldn't recommend jumping out of a cake
rev1-6327295999301499598-00003 my day already feels rather overwhelming
rev1-6327295999301499598-00004 in times of great stress and confusion
rev1-6327295999301499598-00005 i'd say there ought to be less of it
rev1-6327295999301499598-00007 for your information
rev1-6327295999301499598-00008 probably best take care of yourself
rev1-6327295999301499598-00010 a splenic artery aneurysm repair
rev1-6327570447711650000-00004 have you no feelings
rev1-6327570447711650000-00005 you've been robbed
rev1-6327609102417316299-00002 it existed in a time warp
rev1-6327609102417316299-00004 take all the nutrients and energy back into the soil where it can be used by the plants again to
rev1-6327609102417316299-00006 all these plants would die
rev1-6327609102417316299-00010 maybe some disturbed vegetation
rev1-6327609102417316299-00011 thick bamboo breaks
rev1-6327609102417316299-00012 it's really hard to stay quiet around here
rev1-6327713470253076639-00001 then they can be re buried with all the dignity they deserve
rev1-6327713470253076639-00002 we would probably have a different national identity
rev1-6327713470253076639-00004 and if they do turn out to be those of alfred
rev1-6327713470253076639-00007 but that was only the start of the story
rev1-6327713470253076639-00009 so in honour of his father
rev1-6327713470253076639-00011 just four years after his burial
rev1-6327713470253076639-00012 by the 9th century
rev1-6327713470253076639-00016 but they were soon enthusiastic about making pilgrimages to rome
rev1-6327713470253076639-00017 alfred's father was no exception and he sent young alfred on two visits to the city
rev1-6327713470253076639-00018 the first in 853 when the boy was just four years old
rev1-6327713470253076639-00019 these visits to the most impressive and powerful city in the western world made a huge impression
rev1-6327713470253076639-00020 and over time it became a permanent saxon base
rev1-6327713470253076639-00021 praying for the protection of the city as he did so
rev1-6327713470253076639-00022 it shaped his thinking as an adult
rev1-6327713470253076639-00023 because he was to grow into a committed
rev1-6327713470253076639-00024 this may have been a special ceremony to honour a son of the royal house of wessex
rev1-6327713470253076639-00025 whatever it really meant
rev1-6327713470253076639-00026 that dominated the landscape
rev1-6327713470253076639-00027 carrying the remains of king alfred
rev1-6327713470253076639-00028 her mother was a member of the mercian royal family
rev1-6327713470253076639-00029 causes severe stomach pain
rev1-6327713470253076639-00030 experts have suggested that the ailment that stuck him down
rev1-6327713470253076639-00031 and affected him for years to come
rev1-6327713470253076639-00032 guthrum and his men mounted a surprise attack
rev1-6327713470253076639-00033 alfred had fought alongside his brothers so he was no stranger to the battlefield
rev1-6327713470253076639-00038 eventually becoming lord chancellor himself
rev1-6327713470253076639-00039 and he made his name helping henry resolve one of the greatest crises of his reign
rev1-6327713470253076639-00040 and all the while
rev1-6327713470253076639-00042 but they're made even more so when you realise that all of this was put in place as part of a
rev1-6327713470253076639-00048 he was also careful to keep half the men in reserve
rev1-6327713470253076639-00049 grimbald from france and
rev1-6327713470253076639-00050 according to howard
rev1-6327713470253076639-00051 the keeper of the jail was a man by the name of mr page
rev1-6327713470253076639-00052 and mr page told him that in advance of the building work
rev1-6327713470253076639-00053 that's 38 in today's money
rev1-6327713470253076639-00054 the reverend william williams
rev1-6327713470253076639-00055 because we only have that one piece
rev1-6327713470253076639-00058 to do further excavation on this site to see what else is turned up
rev1-6327713470253076639-00062 but it's another very important step
rev1-6327740528416575363-00001 all doing it for a living
rev1-6327740528416575363-00003 because they are next
rev1-6327740528416575363-00004 and that's how they do it
rev1-6327740528416575363-00005 that kind of entices the general managers into thinking
rev1-6327740528416575363-00006 wages and salaries are about 900 billion
rev1-6327740528416575363-00007 although four billion sounds a huge amount of money
rev1-6327740528416575363-00008 it comes either from the owners of companies
rev1-6327740528416575363-00009 the negative effect is that people might in the end find getting jobs much more difficult
rev1-6327740528416575363-00010 not because they're thrown out of work because of the minimum wage
rev1-6327740528416575363-00011 with clean sheets
rev1-6327740528416575363-00012 is part and parcel of working in housekeeping
rev1-6327740528416575363-00013 let me finish now
rev1-6327740528416575363-00015 this is getting your rejects
rev1-6327740528416575363-00017 we want to work
rev1-6327740528416575363-00019 and in this hotel
rev1-6327740528416575363-00020 if i'm being honest
rev1-6327740528416575363-00021 and i don't think we should have to live like that
rev1-6327740528416575363-00022 not when he works so hard
rev1-6327740528416575363-00023 i think i'm a lot bigger in personality
rev1-6327740528416575363-00024 do you think in certain sectors it keeps the wages down because migrants are prepared to work for
rev1-6327740528416575363-00025 they do say that migration has kept a downward pressure on wages in
rev1-6327740528416575363-00026 who may think that those jobs aren't the kind of jobs they want to do
rev1-6327740528416575363-00027 but i think that rather than think
rev1-6327740528416575363-00028 the problem is migration and therefore we should stop that
rev1-6327740528416575363-00036 because people come here
rev1-6327740528416575363-00037 they want to work
rev1-6327740528416575363-00038 they will then pay taxes
rev1-6327740528416575363-00039 i used to have people for dinner once a week
rev1-6327941532886024424-00001 the safer society will be
rev1-6327941532886024424-00002 full of contrition
rev1-6327941532886024424-00006 you realise what this means
rev1-6327980187591690710-00003 that will be really helpful
rev1-6328038169780654524-00001 many of them left from here in southampton
rev1-6328038169780654524-00003 the valentines' six cylinder diesel engines roared into life
rev1-6328038169780654524-00004 with the canvas screens providing little
rev1-6328038169780654524-00005 protection from the incoming waves
rev1-6328038169780654524-00008 what it would have been like for someone like frank
rev1-6328038169780654524-00009 eight ounces of gunpowder
rev1-6328038169780654524-00010 brown paper bag
rev1-6328038169780654524-00012 small explosives could be detonated to break off the tail section
rev1-6328038169780654524-00013 technology was the silent ally
rev1-6328038169780654524-00014 it paved the way for men to fight on the beaches of normandy
rev1-6328111613590949805-00003 who is an expert in york
rev1-6328111613590949805-00004 it says it there
rev1-6328111613590949805-00006 someone called wimpy klop
rev1-6328111613590949805-00009 can we get the owners to agree
rev1-6328111613590949805-00010 so after the second world war
rev1-6328111613590949805-00012 and get the money
rev1-6328111613590949805-00013 we call him the old general
rev1-6328111613590949805-00015 he was staying with them
rev1-6328111613590949805-00016 normally what we would do is we would package up this information and we would present it to a
rev1-6328111613590949805-00017 in this litigious environment in the united states
rev1-6328111613590949805-00018 what worries people is being sued
rev1-6328111613590949805-00019 and what difference would it make to you if we could prove it
rev1-6328111613590949805-00021 so quite a long time ago
rev1-6328111613590949805-00023 it's always going to raise questions
rev1-6328111613590949805-00024 it's from bruce kaiser
rev1-6328111613590949805-00025 i would guess the probability of this occurring randomly approaches the same probability of someone
rev1-6328111613590949805-00026 using the same paint in exactly the same way
rev1-6328111613590949805-00027 if we can do that
rev1-6328111613590949805-00029 the sad fact is you may not own this picture
rev1-6328111613590949805-00030 because even if there is confusion about the ownership
rev1-6328312618060398848-00009 thank you for supporting my malvolio
rev1-6328312618060398848-00010 photography is very much part of show business
rev1-6328312618060398848-00011 if the royal shakespeare company give me suitable parts
rev1-6328351272766065122-00002 especially mammal life
rev1-6328351272766065122-00003 but working as a team
rev1-6328351272766065122-00006 why is it so valuable
rev1-6328351272766065122-00007 when the scales became in great demand for asian wildlife trade
rev1-6328393792942295524-00001 spend some time making sure we get it exactly right
rev1-6328393792942295524-00002 it's much better because you don't create landfill and you're reusing what you've got about
rev1-6328393792942295524-00003 it's five to one
rev1-6328393792942295524-00004 which means it's five sand to one cement
rev1-6328393792942295524-00005 so there doesn't need to be a layer of hardcore beneath the cement and brick
rev1-6328393792942295524-00006 and my grandma and my grandad
rev1-6328393792942295524-00010 and birds actually like to be able to hop in and look around in a hedge
rev1-6328512334039666732-00003 is it possible to do that
rev1-6328512334039666732-00005 it's got to be the sugar in combination with other things
rev1-6328512334039666732-00007 when we are exposed to different things
rev1-6328512334039666732-00008 judging from today
rev1-6328512334039666732-00010 as ruth goodman's been learning
rev1-6328512334039666732-00012 stop consuming it
rev1-6328512334039666732-00013 with the entire industry based upon slavery
rev1-6328656644940810739-00006 they can come here and spend some time relaxing
rev1-6328656644940810739-00011 i'd rather be in josh's spot
rev1-6328764878116731644-00002 this is the show where all the questions have been asked to 100 people before the show
rev1-6328764878116731644-00003 and all our celebrities have to do is come up with the answers that none of those 100 people could
rev1-6328764878116731644-00005 each of our celebrities is playing for a nominated charity
rev1-6328764878116731644-00007 we just had a ball
rev1-6328764878116731644-00008 let's just talk about m people
rev1-6328764878116731644-00010 a lot of people
rev1-6328764878116731644-00013 let's change and get back to gardening as well
rev1-6328764878116731644-00014 who was your drummer
rev1-6328764878116731644-00019 six on the second
rev1-6328764878116731644-00021 let's play our five little tracks and here they are
rev1-6328764878116731644-00022 and it's a multisensory centre for people with special needs
rev1-6328764878116731644-00023 which is the twins and multiple births association and they actually helped me and gave me lots of
rev1-6328764878116731644-00025 if it's right and it's pointless
rev1-6328764878116731644-00028 this has to be pointless for you to win that jackpot
rev1-6328764878116731644-00029 as today's show is a celebrity special
rev1-6328764878116731644-00030 join us next time
rev1-6328764878116731644-00031 when we'll be putting more obscure knowledge to the test on pointless
rev1-6328764878116731644-00032 and playing us out with moving on up
rev1-6328962017115556355-00001 so that's a very healthy young plant
rev1-6328962017115556355-00002 instead of being opposite one another
rev1-6328962017115556355-00003 we're used to crab apples being big fruit
rev1-6328962017115556355-00004 which are about three or four years older
rev1-6328962017115556355-00007 some of my favourite fruits
rev1-6328962017115556355-00009 they store the damp
rev1-6328962017115556355-00010 i just keep trying different stuff and the stuff that works and looks right
rev1-6328962017115556355-00011 because that's it
rev1-6329054788409218032-00003 ten favourite dishes that i cook
rev1-6329054788409218032-00004 i don't fancy that
rev1-6329054788409218032-00008 so i hope that he does like it
rev1-6329054788409218032-00016 they did amazingly well
rev1-6329054788409218032-00017 they're eating healthier
rev1-6329062519350282760-00002 because using vegetables in a dessert has become more popular nowadays
rev1-6329062519350282760-00006 but anything can happen with dessert
rev1-6329062519350282760-00008 he's got 15 minutes left to go
rev1-6329062519350282760-00009 his ice cream is not even in the machine
rev1-6329062519350282760-00011 regardless of their background
rev1-6329062519350282760-00013 right hand out to shake
rev1-6329062519350282760-00014 and then step back
rev1-6329062519350282760-00016 through to the judges
rev1-6329062519350282760-00017 i didn't want to be going home on thursday
rev1-6329151425173313518-00001 i know i don't sound it
rev1-6329151425173313518-00002 but i'm a scot by birth
rev1-6329151425173313518-00003 for what it's worth
rev1-6329151425173313518-00004 it was rather male
rev1-6329151425173313518-00005 it felt slightly dark
rev1-6329151425173313518-00006 it was fiercely pro british unionist and it was mildly conservative
rev1-6329151425173313518-00007 in every possible cultural way
rev1-6329151425173313518-00010 where women seem to be running almost everything and which is
rev1-6329151425173313518-00011 so the question is very straightforward and simple to pose
rev1-6329151425173313518-00013 the scottish conservative and unionist party
rev1-6329151425173313518-00015 an achievement that would stand for half a century to come
rev1-6329151425173313518-00016 the tories then could have called themselves the party of scotland
rev1-6329151425173313518-00017 back in the day
rev1-6329151425173313518-00018 there were lots of small businesses
rev1-6329151425173313518-00023 and all these industries
rev1-6329151425173313518-00024 which had a great past
rev1-6329151425173313518-00025 the tories got the blame for that
rev1-6329151425173313518-00026 you also became
rev1-6329151425173313518-00029 and they were immensely proud of the ships they sent down the clyde
rev1-6329151425173313518-00030 many of them royal naval ships
rev1-6329151425173313518-00031 and if you weren't labour
rev1-6329151425173313518-00033 the women in the scheme in old monkland
rev1-6329151425173313518-00034 that i was born and brought up in
rev1-6329151425173313518-00035 they were at the doors because this was a girl from coatbridge going to the uni
rev1-6329151425173313518-00036 the end of heavy industry on the clyde and so forth
rev1-6329151425173313518-00037 people had to move away
rev1-6329151425173313518-00039 what scotland now is
rev1-6329151425173313518-00040 produces a post industrial politics
rev1-6329151425173313518-00041 what does that mean
rev1-6329151425173313518-00042 going to this school
rev1-6329151425173313518-00043 therefore i vote for that party
rev1-6329151425173313518-00044 which gave them power at the heart of the labour party and therefore at westminster
rev1-6329151425173313518-00046 she was an attractive woman
rev1-6329151425173313518-00047 could sustain itself
rev1-6329151425173313518-00049 ladies and gentlemen
rev1-6329151425173313518-00051 i stand before you
rev1-6329151425173313518-00054 and if you wish it
rev1-6329151425173313518-00055 even in the 1979 general election
rev1-6329151425173313518-00056 margaret thatcher's great triumph
rev1-6329151425173313518-00057 labour in scotland had a clear majority
rev1-6329151425173313518-00058 44 out of 71 of the available seats
rev1-6329151425173313518-00061 you something something lunatic
rev1-6329151425173313518-00062 if they push on with the unacceptable proposals of recent years
rev1-6329151425173313518-00064 it looks from the latest figures
rev1-6329151425173313518-00066 then basically what was left tended to be non catholic
rev1-6329151425173313518-00067 who set up the adam smith institute subsequently
rev1-6329151425173313518-00068 even more important
rev1-6329151425173313518-00071 when the big state was at its biggest
rev1-6329151425173313518-00072 just two years before she was forced from power
rev1-6329151425173313518-00074 perhaps it would be best
rev1-6329151425173313518-00075 but first they had to believe in wealth creation
rev1-6329151425173313518-00076 otherwise where did the money come from
rev1-6329151425173313518-00077 and they had to believe in original sin
rev1-6329151425173313518-00078 and that they should look after their own families first and they should not depend on high
rev1-6329151425173313518-00079 scots had had enough of what they regarded as margaret thatcher's grating
rev1-6329151425173313518-00080 that perfectly manicured fingernail jabbing at them
rev1-6329151425173313518-00081 the churchmen made it clear they were distinctly unamused
rev1-6329151425173313518-00082 they spoke for many scots
rev1-6329151425173313518-00085 but they're predictable conservative attacks
rev1-6329151425173313518-00086 the randomness of human life is very
rev1-6329151425173313518-00087 we would not have lived through new labour
rev1-6329151425173313518-00088 more than 22 years on
rev1-6329151425173313518-00090 the tories would have been different
rev1-6329151425173313518-00092 over domestic affairs
rev1-6329151425173313518-00093 in the 1970s had been a dominant issue in the politics of the labour government at that time
rev1-6329151425173313518-00095 part of every one of us
rev1-6329151425173313518-00096 and we respect it
rev1-6329151425173313518-00098 if there are any
rev1-6329151425173313518-00099 but especially in the local areas
rev1-6329151425173313518-00100 that didn't mean it wasn't successful in scotland
rev1-6329151425173313518-00101 while you had much
rev1-6329151425173313518-00102 much disillusionment with the labour party in scotland
rev1-6329151425173313518-00103 and i think that is
rev1-6329151425173313518-00104 a combination of that
rev1-6329151425173313518-00105 because people in scotland wanted a parliament
rev1-6329151425173313518-00107 because people wanted
rev1-6329151425173313518-00108 scotland wanted a scottish parliament and therefore
rev1-6329151425173313518-00111 where people want a greater sense of identity
rev1-6329151425173313518-00112 look for identity
rev1-6329151425173313518-00113 where identity politics is much more important
rev1-6329151425173313518-00114 whether it's uk and brussels
rev1-6329151425173313518-00115 or whether it's
rev1-6329151425173313518-00116 legal and decisive
rev1-6329151425173313518-00117 in the coming days
rev1-6329151425173313518-00118 and i think then we need to move forward and say
rev1-6329151425173313518-00119 if there are problems of uncertainty and lack of clarity
rev1-6329151425173313518-00120 and i don't think we should just let this go on year after year
rev1-6329835613463566698-00001 tell me what would you do
rev1-6329835613463566698-00002 would you buy this
rev1-6329835613463566698-00005 this is quite a bold project and yet you don't seem remotely fazed by any of it
rev1-6329835613463566698-00007 maybe that's incredibly naive of me but i just think it will be ok and it will all work out
rev1-6329835613463566698-00011 imagine the kind of farmer who has leisure time
rev1-6329835613463566698-00014 in the section about the dudleston farms
rev1-6329835613463566698-00015 once we get over these issues
rev1-6329835613463566698-00017 these actually carry the sashes and the weights in here
rev1-6329835613463566698-00018 we can't finish our structural phase of our mortgage
rev1-6329835613463566698-00020 which we don't need
rev1-6329835613463566698-00021 she wants them to read
rev1-6329835613463566698-00022 at the end of the day
rev1-6329835613463566698-00023 we can say it wasn't in budget but it needs to be done
rev1-6329835613463566698-00024 it's got a missing tooth
rev1-6329835613463566698-00025 he also founded the local grammar school
rev1-6329835613463566698-00026 the grant was obtained under which was founded the royal free grammar school of shrewsbury
rev1-6329835613463566698-00027 who is that person
rev1-6329893595522062514-00003 me and my best mate
rev1-6329893595522062514-00004 not for any other reason
rev1-6329893595522062514-00005 i'm not doing it
rev1-6329893595522062514-00006 i'm not flaming going in the transport that he's organised
rev1-6329893595522062514-00007 what is the plural for mecca
rev1-6329893595522062514-00009 at the same level of their profession
rev1-6329893595522062514-00010 three michelin stars
rev1-6329893595522122781-00002 it's all been fairly recent
rev1-6329893595522122781-00005 it's not diabetes
rev1-6329893595522122781-00006 it's not an infection
rev1-6329893595522122781-00007 it's not a stroke
rev1-6329893595522122781-00008 i feel like we're running out of time
rev1-6329893595522122781-00010 normal antibody levels
rev1-6329893595522122781-00011 similar partial paralysis
rev2-6300370419826092098-00001 so we need you to help us in our revival campaign
rev2-6300370419826092098-00002 or into vodka and adding a bit of honey
rev2-6300370419826092098-00003 those should have rooted
rev2-6300370419826092098-00004 maybe in a greenhouse
rev2-6300370419826092098-00006 versatile plant with so many great uses
rev2-6300370419826092098-00007 i think they're an important part of our heritage and one that we should be proud to revive
rev2-6300370419826092098-00010 but the gardens have been swept away by later monarchs demonstrating later
rev2-6300370419826092098-00012 that's the point
rev2-6300370419826092098-00013 so they look radically different but their origins are actually from the same place
rev2-6300370419826092098-00014 what are the key practicalities
rev2-6300370419826092098-00016 they look fantastic
rev2-6300370419826092098-00018 which gives me a very instantly recognisable design
rev2-6300370419826092098-00020 crunchy lettuce but
rev2-6300370419826092098-00024 they're very low maintenance
rev2-6300370419826092098-00025 they offer year round structure and the design
rev2-6301320037095305408-00002 the gist of it is
rev2-6301320037095305408-00003 i'll have it all squared
rev2-6301320037095305408-00004 just when you think you're having the worst day possible
rev2-6301320037095305408-00006 that kit has to be here at 11 o'clock
rev2-6301320037095305408-00007 all those people want to take my picture
rev2-6301320037095305408-00009 if you don't go under again
rev2-6301320037095305408-00010 like i never do
rev2-6302978323968228875-00005 even if it's only a single one
rev2-6302978323968228875-00007 and for the customers
rev2-6302978323968228875-00008 don't bring tom
rev2-6302978323968228875-00010 why did you bring me in here
rev2-6302978323968228875-00011 whether you've got a window box
rev2-6302978323968228875-00012 whether you've got a hanging basket
rev2-6302978323968228875-00013 if you soak the flowers of this they've just come out the greenhouse you'll end up blemishing the
rev2-6302978323968228875-00015 without people like yourselves
rev2-6302978323968228875-00016 the pelargonium industry
rev2-6302978323968228875-00017 you've been sniffing those geranium leaves
rev2-6302978323968228875-00019 not just in the uk
rev2-6302978323968228875-00020 but in the world
rev2-6302978323968228875-00021 between four to six weeks' time and by the end of this season
rev2-6302978323968228875-00022 september or october
rev2-6302978323968228875-00023 very nice looking plant by early autumn and then you're multiplying your favourite
rev2-6303167732026041278-00001 the majestic kirby hall in northamptonshire
rev2-6303167732026041278-00004 also wanted the queen to come and stay at his house
rev2-6303167732026041278-00005 let's talk about them
rev2-6303167732026041278-00006 under the glass domes
rev2-6303167732026041278-00007 possibly even into the early part of the 20th century
rev2-6303167732026041278-00011 but was in need of some serious tlc
rev2-6303167732026041278-00013 i wasn't given it
rev2-6303167732026041278-00014 i was virtually given it
rev2-6303167732026041278-00017 there was no paint in the way that we understand it
rev2-6303167732026041278-00018 and single objects that are found in this way
rev2-6303167732026041278-00019 are very seldom viewed as treasure trove
rev2-6303167732026041278-00023 in its day it was home to sumptuous wealth and sir christopher hatton
rev2-6306811582279909115-00001 and it was once voted the most haunted house in britain
rev2-6306811582279909115-00003 more than 400 years later
rev2-6306811582279909115-00004 on the anniversary of her death
rev2-6306811582279909115-00005 it's said her headless ghost arrives here in a carriage driven by headless horses and a headless
rev2-6306811582279909115-00006 i'll be back here to find out what really goes on behind the closed doors of this beautiful and
rev2-6306811582279909115-00007 you might consider house hunting in norfolk
rev2-6306811582279909115-00009 making homes in this lovely county incredible value for those seeking a rural retreat
rev2-6306811582279909115-00010 which is great news for today's buyers
rev2-6306811582279909115-00011 we have the seaside
rev2-6306811582279909115-00012 you're both retired
rev2-6306811582279909115-00013 there are some converted barns
rev2-6306811582279909115-00014 and the same person that converted those built this house in the same style
rev2-6306811582279909115-00015 because nigel was so stern about the budget
rev2-6306811582279909115-00018 that's my whole life sorted
rev2-6306811582279909115-00019 and it really is all she ever talks about
rev2-6306811582279909115-00021 and then had it built
rev2-6306811582279909115-00022 i think it's a gorgeous place
rev2-6306811582279909115-00023 it was on the market for 450
rev2-6306811582279909115-00025 with the other homes
rev2-6306811582279909115-00026 we've tried to accommodate the family that they're going to be leaving behind
rev2-6306811582279909115-00027 but the mystery house
rev2-6306811582279909115-00030 the question is
rev2-6306811582279909115-00033 it really was the perfect home for them and the family
rev2-6306811582279909115-00034 it had everything they asked for
rev2-6306811582279909115-00035 and even though he needs some time
rev2-6306870852828565379-00002 in the fairy tales
rev2-6306870852828565379-00004 in making people think that they had a common german heritage to look back
rev2-6306870852828565379-00006 according to my guidebook
rev2-6306870852828565379-00007 occupations are chiefly with timber
rev2-6306870852828565379-00008 was heard in these valleys
rev2-6306870852828565379-00010 eastern railways were still advertising trips to germany and 6
rev2-6306870852828565379-00013 thoughts about the beauty of nature
rev2-6306870852828565379-00014 now it's surrounded by the skyscrapers of the modern city of frankfurt
rev2-6306870852828565379-00015 there were three stations before that
rev2-6306870852828565379-00016 i love to stay in a traditional hotel
rev2-6306870852828565379-00017 that's the impression many people have
rev2-6306870852828565379-00018 and the problem is people don't really understand that much about economics
rev2-6306870852828565379-00019 where he was born in 1749
rev2-6306870852828565379-00021 by your language
rev2-6306870852828565379-00022 i think without the burschenschaften
rev2-6306870852828565379-00023 for the first time in the world
rev2-6306870852828565379-00024 you're blowing air between these two points
rev2-6306870852828565379-00026 models of trains
rev2-6306870852828565379-00027 amongst the many german states that had been overrun by the french emperor napoleon and whose
rev2-6306870852828565379-00028 there arose the idea of creating a nation
rev2-6306870852828565379-00029 germany was a great power
rev2-6308177381880006979-00001 the writing garden which
rev2-6308177381880006979-00002 is mainly white
rev2-6308177381880006979-00004 but i do want to share and celebrate the animals that are enjoying it
rev2-6308177381880006979-00005 but the flowers are over now
rev2-6308177381880006979-00006 doesn't look good
rev2-6308177381880006979-00007 not much else is getting a benefit from it
rev2-6308177381880006979-00008 even though you can't see it
rev2-6308177381880006979-00010 but i think it can be done
rev2-6308177381880006979-00011 when you're planting for bees in particular
rev2-6308177381880006979-00012 but insects in general
rev2-6308177381880006979-00013 it's covering what i'm doing now
rev2-6308177381880006979-00017 so that should anything happen in one area where the plants were displayed
rev2-6308177381880006979-00022 but not until you've done these jobs for the weekend
rev2-6308177381880006979-00024 not least from the building and grounds
rev2-6308177381880006979-00026 i don't flood them every now and then and let them dry out
rev2-6308177381880006979-00027 grow them on and you'll be harvesting them in late september and october
rev2-6308177381880006979-00028 as the only female in a hard
rev2-6308312673349834578-00004 wombats are like little bulldozers
rev2-6308312673349834578-00008 this is the kangaroo bible
rev2-6308312673349834578-00010 i give him a teddy bear or a punching bag
rev2-6308312673349834578-00013 it's a good feeling
rev2-6309468449049188125-00004 it's gone from tired and old
rev2-6309468449049188125-00006 and he's old school
rev2-6309468449049188125-00007 and he's going to turn those battered old doors into something saleable
rev2-6309468449049188125-00016 chunky bits of timber
rev2-6309468449049188125-00017 and they are really rough and ready
rev2-6309468449049188125-00018 it's going to be a lot of work
rev2-6309468449049188125-00020 with a new baby on the way
rev2-6309468449049188125-00021 that 99 will definitely come in handy
rev2-6309468449049188125-00024 norman has made something really beautiful with those old scraps
rev2-6309468449049188125-00026 we've handed over a little bit of money along the way
rev2-6309824072341293478-00001 i'm ted and i'm studying to become a barrister
rev2-6309824072341293478-00002 very much we practised for it
rev2-6309824072341293478-00004 i don't know anything about ella eyre but on the basis that ellie goulding definitely had an album
rev2-6309824072341293478-00005 i guess i'll go for her
rev2-6309824072341293478-00007 i think it's a white cross on a blue background
rev2-6309824072341293478-00008 this is what we have been playing towards
rev2-6309824072341293478-00009 it is time for the final round
rev2-6309824072341293478-00010 i have read about him
rev2-6310166810731517953-00002 they talk a lot about the feel of natural energy in an arena
rev2-6310166810731517953-00005 as far as vienna at one time
rev2-6310166810731517953-00007 probably been at the heart of human affairs
rev2-6310166810731517953-00009 for new generation and new age
rev2-6310166810731517953-00011 i don't remember
rev2-6310166810731517953-00014 all of these troglodyte caves everywhere and the nice landscape
rev2-6310166810731517953-00015 many years later
rev2-6310166810731517953-00016 because it was empty
rev2-6310166810731517953-00017 when i was a little child
rev2-6310166810731517953-00025 so it's against islamic law
rev2-6310166810731517953-00026 i'm really not a good muslim person
rev2-6310195157515669986-00001 the show where a team of five quiz challengers pit their wits against possibly the greatest quiz
rev2-6310195157515669986-00002 i'm kim and i'm an ncs recruitment officer
rev2-6310195157515669986-00004 that was brilliant
rev2-6310195157515669986-00005 i'm katherine and i'm a mentoring coordinator
rev2-6310195157515669986-00006 so it's a round
rev2-6310195157515669986-00008 nothing at all is coming
rev2-6310195157515669986-00009 wouldn't it be nice to get on with me neighbours
rev2-6310195157515669986-00010 i can't even think of a sensible answer
rev2-6310195157515669986-00011 i do know it when i heard the answer
rev2-6310195157515669986-00012 i know the song
rev2-6310195157515669986-00014 but i thought 40
rev2-6310195157515669986-00015 it's time for the final round
rev2-6310195157515669986-00016 so on that basis
rev2-6310195157515669986-00017 so we're going to go with royal standard
rev2-6310968251628953184-00001 and they might not even make it through the first battle
rev2-6310968251628953184-00002 ladies and gentlemen
rev2-6310968251628953184-00010 it may not look anything like it does now
rev2-6310968251628953184-00011 or did to start the fight
rev2-6310968251628953184-00014 and had a look at what was remaining
rev2-6310968251628953184-00018 for the last time tonight
rev2-6311014637275749987-00001 sports is once again hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons
rev2-6311014637275749987-00002 you get them in the post
rev2-6311014637275749987-00003 with that much at stake
rev2-6311014637275749987-00007 and then the shame
rev2-6311014637275749987-00012 ask him what he's taking
rev2-6311014637275749987-00013 how he's taking them
rev2-6311014637275749987-00014 who's he get them off
rev2-6311014637275749987-00018 and then when i met natalie
rev2-6311014637275749987-00025 and there are people who will say
rev2-6311014637275749987-00026 he only got into that much trouble because he took too much
rev2-6311014637275749987-00027 but that definitely isn't true
rev2-6311014637275749987-00028 these are dangerous drugs
rev2-6311014637275749987-00029 they just want to look better
rev2-6311014637275749987-00030 male pattern baldness
rev2-6311014637275749987-00031 impaired erectile function
rev2-6311014637275749987-00032 and in about 10 of the cases
rev2-6311014637275749987-00033 the cells die prematurely
rev2-6311014637275749987-00034 the longer that you have been taking your steroids
rev2-6311014637275749987-00035 it would be very worrying
rev2-6311014637275749987-00036 because this would mean that men who take steroids over long periods of time might be at greater
rev2-6311014637275749987-00037 and that the vast majority of cigarette smokers were still under the age of 50 now
rev2-6311014637275749987-00038 in that scenario
rev2-6311014637275749987-00039 the occasional report of emphysema
rev2-6311014637275749987-00040 the heart in fact is the strongest muscle in the body
rev2-6311014637275749987-00041 and it's the only muscle that never rests
rev2-6311014637275749987-00043 they have not gone through clinical trials
rev2-6311014637275749987-00044 and yet their use does not exist in the shadows
rev2-6311014637275749987-00046 but these new molecules have never been approved for human use
rev2-6311014637275749987-00047 it's not a big statistical trial
rev2-6311014637275749987-00048 i think because i
rev2-6311014637275749987-00049 like everyone else
rev2-6311014637275749987-00050 would like to look a bit better and would like a magic injection to do it
rev2-6311014637275749987-00051 but this is not the way
rev2-6311014637275749987-00052 these are dangerous drugs
rev2-6311014637275749987-00053 you're on all these dosages
rev2-6311014637275749987-00054 how do you feel
rev2-6311014637275749987-00055 that i've got a tummy
rev2-6311014637275749987-00056 which means that they have to tell us where they're available to be tested every single day of the
rev2-6311014637275749987-00057 and i was immediately
rev2-6311014637275749987-00058 the day that paper came out
rev2-6311014637275749987-00060 i had no idea that was coming
rev2-6311014637275749987-00063 and at that point
rev2-6311014637275749987-00064 if you're anything like me
rev2-6311014637275749987-00066 i've roped in my identical twin brother
rev2-6311014637275749987-00068 so what were going to be doing is passing a very mild electrical current over an area of the brain
rev2-6311014637275749987-00069 maybe a slight burning
rev2-6311280066254641716-00006 is covered with paintings
rev2-6311280066254641716-00010 trying to find direction
rev2-6311280066254641716-00013 how much has romania changed
rev2-6311651151429016127-00001 there was one house on this grand and elegant street where you never wanted to end up
rev2-6311651151429016127-00003 but you also have to remember the location of hungary
rev2-6311651151429016127-00004 where we are located
rev2-6311651151429016127-00014 much more independent
rev2-6311651151429016127-00015 this is the levadia palace
rev2-6311651151429016127-00018 and many of them have positive
rev2-6311651151429016127-00019 nice memories of the soviet days
rev2-6312022236603390541-00004 and they think that tradition's not necessary
rev2-6312022236603390541-00008 because this is
rev2-6312022236603390541-00009 so it was very exciting
rev2-6312022236603390541-00010 that's for our president
rev2-6312022236603390541-00012 as well as russian academy of science
rev2-6312066045269810824-00004 met irving while he was in new york city
rev2-6312066045269810824-00006 they raised their glasses and the toast was
rev2-6312066045269810824-00007 down with the train
rev2-6312066045269810824-00008 and a whole budget of others
rev2-6312066045269810824-00010 as any cadet at the academy could tell you
rev2-6312066045269810824-00012 is one of the most attractive places on the river and the seat of the national military academy
rev2-6312066045269810824-00015 without a doubt
rev2-6312066045269810824-00016 it came close to almost destroying this nation
rev2-6312066045269810824-00017 31 years on active duty as a colonel
rev2-6312066045269810824-00021 having come to know a little bit about this mighty river
rev2-6312066045269810824-00022 i personally would always choose a railway line
rev2-6312066045269810824-00023 going back to that to try to form a stronger american identity when so many things are being
rev2-6312066045269810824-00026 new york made a statement
rev2-6312066045269810824-00027 it will be the largest and most splendid edifice in america
rev2-6312066045269810824-00028 we're a lot different than other states in terms of our philosophy
rev2-6313565847849574520-00003 50 of the robots gone at the very
rev2-6313565847849574520-00006 and we will follow them
rev2-6313565847849574520-00013 for the last time tonight
rev2-6313656042293295351-00001 my father went to west africa
rev2-6313656042293295351-00003 i'd never seen a black man
rev2-6313656042293295351-00004 to the best of my recollection
rev2-6313656042293295351-00007 and the medical officer might have been your father
rev2-6313656042293295351-00008 it might have been on its own in europe
rev2-6313656042293295351-00009 but it had a vast empire
rev2-6313656042293295351-00012 in the deepest jungle
rev2-6313656042293295351-00014 they've been likened to the battle of stalingrad and the battle of el alamein and midway as
rev2-6313656042293295351-00016 saw that it no longer had the strategic value it had
rev2-6313656042293295351-00018 those fatal shots
rev2-6313877662475262663-00001 things didn't really get much better
rev2-6313877662475262663-00005 they know of python
rev2-6313877662475262663-00012 we're building a house now in the forest
rev2-6313877662475262663-00013 which is coming on very nicely
rev2-6313877662475262663-00015 and we have a lovely daughter whose name actually by the way is chelsea
rev2-6313877662475262663-00016 that's the best that i could ever wish them
rev2-6313877662475262663-00017 i think i can see where you're coming from asking that question
rev2-6313877662475262663-00018 as a brave nation that however has something to offer here and now
rev2-6313877662475262663-00028 what about your love life here
rev2-6313877662475262663-00030 this is a scheduled service
rev2-6313877662475262663-00033 i've great respect for these guys
rev2-6313877662475262663-00034 but it was a great run
rev2-6313877662475262663-00039 and it's really hard physical work
rev2-6313936933024013236-00002 exercise is a waste of time
rev2-6313936933024013236-00004 congratulations about the baby
rev2-6313936933024013236-00006 i was all right in the end
rev2-6313936933024013236-00008 it was a one off
rev2-6313936933024013236-00009 it was a one off
rev2-6313936933024013236-00011 but you have to understand
rev2-6313936933024013236-00014 and phil wouldn't tell me anything
rev2-6314248747649637090-00002 000 foot mountain range in the heart of europe
rev2-6314248747649637090-00003 but these are the high tatras
rev2-6314248747649637090-00004 part of the carpathian range
rev2-6314248747649637090-00009 i think czechs are very social
rev2-6314248747649637090-00013 i guess it was a larger community
rev2-6314248747649637090-00014 not everything was wrong
rev2-6314248747649637090-00015 some people still have the wall in their heads
rev2-6314248747649637090-00017 what people plan
rev2-6314248747649637090-00018 so what was shocking for him was the result
rev2-6314308018198387664-00001 and i may be no action woman
rev2-6314308018198387664-00002 you may find him
rev2-6314308018198387664-00005 are you eating properly
rev2-6314308018198387664-00006 and if he improves
rev2-6314308018198387664-00007 i want to isolate a patient from exposure to the wi fi
rev2-6314308018198387664-00008 if your symptoms fade while you're in here
rev2-6314308018198387664-00009 we're looking back at how sport and music came together in the 80s to create some amazing and some
rev2-6314619832824012968-00002 the portuguese who followed him found indigenous people here
rev2-6314619832824012968-00004 cotton and tobacco that they set up
rev2-6314619832824012968-00007 but it's low tide
rev2-6314619832824012968-00010 this is very powerful
rev2-6314619832824012968-00011 so i might find out something very unpleasant
rev2-6314619832824012968-00012 because i'm going to something
rev2-6314619832824012968-00015 you have to run
rev2-6314990917998387385-00003 there's no road access at all
rev2-6314990917998387385-00004 i'm heading south now
rev2-6314990917998387385-00006 in brazil as well
rev2-6314990917998387385-00007 still we're very
rev2-6315050188547072188-00003 before the railways
rev2-6315050188547072188-00011 the railway lines could then ship it back to the ports
rev2-6315050188547072188-00014 it's a really good
rev2-6315405811839181004-00002 lots of outlying farms and a small collection of buildings
rev2-6315405811839181004-00003 thousands of tonnes of ammunition
rev2-6315405811839181004-00004 so his troops were very hungry
rev2-6315405811839181004-00005 so they ate what they could and
rev2-6315405811839181004-00006 whatever they couldn't carry off
rev2-6315405811839181004-00007 the confederate commander
rev2-6315405811839181004-00008 a lot of people consider that one of his greatest victories because he drove the union army from
rev2-6315405811839181004-00009 but i think it's important that when we look back on that and take a certain pride in that that we
rev2-6315405811839181004-00010 it was founded in 1727 and contains about 6
rev2-6315405811839181004-00011 an ideal place for me to begin to discover the spirit of the
rev2-6315405811839181004-00012 when i'm going to sit down in the evening with a nice glass of bourbon
rev2-6315405811839181004-00018 wondering if they're doing it correctly
rev2-6315405811839181004-00019 we didn't see any of that with you
rev2-6315405811839181004-00021 after two months of active debating
rev2-6315405811839181004-00022 88 voted to secede
rev2-6315405811839181004-00023 i feel much that makes me feel at home
rev2-6315405811839181004-00026 what was that saying
rev2-6315405811839181004-00027 that was saying that
rev2-6315405811839181004-00029 tell me about that
rev2-6315405811839181004-00031 it wasn't even close to the uss monitor
rev2-6315405811839181004-00033 only one turret
rev2-6315405811839181004-00034 virtually every major combat vessel that was designed
rev2-6315405811839181004-00035 not only the american navy
rev2-6315405811839181004-00036 but in navy's around the world after the battle of hampton roads
rev2-6315405811839181004-00037 they were new vessels
rev2-6315405811839181004-00041 during the revolution
rev2-6315405811839181004-00042 we see ourselves as something else
rev2-6315405811839181004-00043 later in their history
rev2-6315405811839181004-00044 they didn't much like being told by yankees that they shouldn't own slaves
rev2-6315405811839181004-00045 to use the term
rev2-6315405811839181004-00046 you know that doesn't go very well
rev2-6315405811839181004-00047 when john smith returns to england 1609
rev2-6315405811839181004-00049 and that never works out well
rev2-6315405811839181004-00050 that there are great chunks of virginian history that i did not know
rev2-6315405811839181004-00051 it's kind of overshadowed by massachusetts
rev2-6315405811839181004-00052 after the south lost the war in our civil war
rev2-6315405811839181004-00053 where the indians and the pilgrims sat down together
rev2-6315421273721446605-00002 to get through to the next stage
rev2-6315421273721446605-00003 do go to our website
rev2-6315421273721446605-00006 thanks for watching
rev2-6316024287129869379-00001 more and more people would love to have their own property portfolio
rev2-6316024287129869379-00002 then at least you'd have your foot on the property developing ladder
rev2-6316024287129869379-00003 i've never seen a house like this
rev2-6316024287129869379-00007 it sort of works
rev2-6316024287129869379-00010 made in a local factory
rev2-6316024287129869379-00011 the minton factory
rev2-6316024287129869379-00012 but you've got to be very
rev2-6316024287129869379-00013 we looked at a load of houses in the university area
rev2-6316024287129869379-00014 i work part time
rev2-6316024287129869379-00016 they seem to be as sad as i will be to see this floor in the back go
rev2-6316024287129869379-00017 but they mean noise and traffic
rev2-6316024287129869379-00018 the road itself is attractive
rev2-6316024287129869379-00023 that is what lets this flat down
rev2-6316024287129869379-00024 i'd expect to get 1
rev2-6316024287129869379-00027 long gap with trying to sort out the paperwork
rev2-6316024287129869379-00028 i don't think john will have the same problem here
rev2-6316024287129869379-00029 where will john decide he wants the wet room
rev2-6316024287129869379-00030 will their friendship survive this tooting transformation
rev2-6316024287129869379-00032 i wasn't having it
rev2-6316024287129869379-00035 about quarter of a mile from the metro station
rev2-6316024287129869379-00038 so added to all the other things you're going to do to this property
rev2-6316024287129869379-00040 the overall size of it
rev2-6316024287129869379-00042 i'm sure it generated a lot of interest when it went under the hammer
rev2-6316024287129869379-00045 if this is a business
rev2-6316024287129869379-00047 time has passed
rev2-6316024287129869379-00048 paul and andy have got themselves a great property here
rev2-6316024287129869379-00049 and they're making the slight error of not costing in their own time and effort which
rev2-6316163444070195447-00001 they're both still working right now
rev2-6316163444070195447-00007 he's driving well
rev2-6316163444070195447-00008 it's normally something simple
rev2-6318761040290818803-00009 so we're really happy that we got to do that
rev2-6318761040290818803-00012 the flipper was only firing at half power in the last fight
rev2-6318761040290818803-00013 as well as being cold
rev2-6318761040290818803-00019 not just robots
rev2-6318761040290818803-00021 we couldn't have imagined ten
rev2-6318761040290818803-00022 and the price of sensors
rev2-6318761040290818803-00023 and even the house robots aren't safe
rev2-6318761040290818803-00024 for the final time tonight
rev2-6318761040290818803-00026 that's what we do
rev2-6321358636511442057-00002 used it very intelligently
rev2-6321358636511442057-00003 by running away
rev2-6321358636511442057-00004 getting it up to speed and making the attack at the right precise moment
rev2-6321358636511442057-00005 you might have a really nice well engineered machine
rev2-6321358636511442057-00006 ready for the next battle
rev2-6321358636511442057-00008 it was not a knockout
rev2-6321358636511442057-00010 the gas system was misbehaving
rev2-6321358636511442057-00015 even though it lasted the whole three minutes
rev2-6321358636511442057-00017 but who will win
rev2-6322100806860254619-00006 i give you guy self
rev2-6322100806860254619-00008 even when it wasn't his fault
rev2-6322100806860254619-00009 family of my own
rev2-6323198600501050831-00003 it's freezing cold
rev2-6323198600501050831-00006 just loved the lifestyle
rev2-6323198600501050831-00007 working these antisocial hours
rev2-6323198600501050831-00008 there is some health risk
rev2-6323198600501050831-00013 the final test for our final four
rev2-6323198600501050831-00016 and make no mistake
rev2-6323198600501050831-00017 as long as you have got the right training to do the job
rev2-6323198600501050831-00018 you've got the right tools to do the job
rev2-6323198600501050831-00019 you know exactly what's being monitored and why and you know how you can influence that
rev2-6323198600501050831-00020 they might suffer from low self esteem
rev2-6323198600501050831-00022 it's interesting that
rev2-6323198600501050831-00023 when you make monitoring more intense
rev2-6323198600501050831-00024 i don't think we are
rev2-6323198600501050831-00025 and if we want a prosperous
rev2-6323198600501050831-00027 and often in sort of a capacity of care
rev2-6323198600501050831-00029 new jobs do arise
rev2-6323198600501050831-00030 new jobs are created
rev2-6323198600501050831-00032 i think i could live on the minimum wage
rev2-6323198600501050831-00033 that was two reasons
rev2-6323198600501050831-00037 all i've known is farming
rev2-6323221793324446979-00001 look at other gardens
rev2-6323221793324446979-00002 planted in winter
rev2-6323221793324446979-00004 and after last summer's disaster with my grapes
rev2-6323221793324446979-00005 what with wasps and blackbirds
rev2-6323221793324446979-00007 you can simply cut the whole lot flush with the ground round about christmas time and let it start
rev2-6323221793324446979-00008 because there is an element of skill involved
rev2-6323221793324446979-00011 produce their fruit on this year's canes
rev2-6323221793324446979-00012 so it is a job to do
rev2-6323221793324446979-00013 because you don't want more than four or five canes per plant
rev2-6323221793324446979-00015 and so probably my grandfather
rev2-6323221793324446979-00016 who was brought up there
rev2-6323221793324446979-00017 from the same canes
rev2-6323221793324446979-00018 a few years ago
rev2-6323221793324446979-00022 because we think jekyll did it all remotely
rev2-6323221793324446979-00025 and then as autumn comes and it goes
rev2-6323221793324446979-00026 the broccoli can take over the whole space
rev2-6323221793324446979-00028 and by the end of the season it's right up here
rev2-6323221793324446979-00029 and on top of that
rev2-6323221793324446979-00032 i grow vegetables because i like the taste
rev2-6323221793324446979-00035 comparing the two different locations with same varieties
rev2-6323221793324446979-00039 this is hundreds and thousands
rev2-6323221793324446979-00041 so please put any pictures you can on our facebook page
rev2-6323221793324446979-00042 but you've got a bank holiday weekend coming up
rev2-6323221793324446979-00043 so extra time to do extra jobs in the garden
rev2-6323221793324446979-00044 great wasps' nest
rev2-6323221793324446979-00045 which means you stay away
rev2-6323221793324446979-00048 and good flavour this year
rev2-6323817075791736335-00002 will they sink or swim
rev2-6323817075791736335-00010 depending on the age
rev2-6323817075791736335-00013 it's all over the walls
rev2-6323817075791736335-00015 will it have too much of a stigma attached to it
rev2-6323817075791736335-00020 talk me through the two options
rev2-6323817075791736335-00024 i've got the monies in place
rev2-6323817075791736335-00026 he's got the money to complete on the purchase
rev2-6323817075791736335-00028 will he get the planning permission
rev2-6323817075791736335-00029 will he get it sorted out
rev2-6323817075791736335-00030 you can find out later in the show
rev2-6323817075791736335-00032 although in this case
rev2-6323817075791736335-00033 if you're intent on recouping the cash and pocketing the profit
rev2-6323817075791736335-00034 you may very well end up disappointed
rev2-6323817075791736335-00038 this house is probably worth around 120
rev2-6323817075791736335-00041 on paper and in theory
rev2-6323817075791736335-00042 the problem that you're likely to face is actually selling the thing
rev2-6323817075791736335-00046 then you can tell me to shut up
rev2-6323817075791736335-00049 that's fair enough
rev2-6323817075791736335-00050 you have got a great work ethic and
rev2-6323817075791736335-00051 any profit is a profit
rev2-6323817075791736335-00053 some profit is much
rev2-6323817075791736335-00054 much better than none
rev2-6323817075791736335-00055 i'm also pleased he'll consider renting
rev2-6323817075791736335-00056 i just hope whoever bought it was prepared to keep hold
rev2-6323817075791736335-00057 000 on this property
rev2-6323817075791736335-00063 so it would be more sought after
rev2-6323817075791736335-00064 i was expecting around the 70
rev2-6323817075791736335-00065 i have spent a lot of money on these flats
rev2-6323817075791736335-00066 get me money back in the pot
rev2-6323817075791736335-00067 and it gets better
rev2-6323817075791736335-00072 especially the ground floor
rev2-6323817075791736335-00073 whether they be sold or let
rev2-6323817075791736335-00074 it has been done to a high standard
rev2-6323817075791736335-00075 especially for first time buyers
rev2-6323817075791736335-00085 but there's still planning issues to resolve and will he be able to sell the properties
rev2-6323817075791736335-00101 i would suggest that he rents each property out at between 500 and
rev2-6323817075791736335-00106 in order to achieve that
rev2-6323956232732063947-00005 it's a tough fight
rev2-6323956232732063947-00011 all of the robots out there full of energy
rev2-6323956232732063947-00013 we could have flipped them at one point
rev2-6323956232732063947-00017 we can still do it
rev2-6323956232732063947-00019 it healed its scars
rev2-6323956232732063947-00020 this is the final i would have asked for
rev2-6323956232732063947-00022 the teams are ready
rev2-6323956232732063947-00023 for the last time this series
rev2-6323956232732126743-00002 the people of tewkesbury
rev2-6323956232732126743-00003 that came to 483
rev2-6323956232732126743-00004 within two years
rev2-6323956232732126743-00005 and has been turned into a bangle
rev2-6323956232732126743-00006 which in many ways is very wearable
rev2-6323956232732126743-00007 which is not particularly bad news
rev2-6323956232732126743-00008 which is beautiful
rev2-6323956232732126743-00009 that is the designer
rev2-6323956232732126743-00010 but then here on this side
rev2-6323956232732126743-00012 it's after galle's death
rev2-6323956232732126743-00013 but it's still a stunning thing
rev2-6323956232732126743-00014 they are holding that
rev2-6323956232732126743-00016 and i saw this in an auction in australia
rev2-6323956232732126743-00017 they've been in england
rev2-6323956232732126743-00018 there was the father of ornithology
rev2-6323956232732126743-00019 so it was a process partly of print
rev2-6323956232732126743-00020 and if we turn this one round
rev2-6323956232732126743-00024 which was designed in 1900
rev2-6323956232732126743-00025 they were there for espionage
rev2-6323956232732126743-00027 my parents had it before i was born
rev2-6323956232732126743-00028 i was brought up with it
rev2-6323956232732126743-00029 and it is just so remarkably stylish
rev2-6323956232732126743-00030 just look at it
rev2-6323956232732126743-00032 like never before
rev2-6323956232732126743-00034 it's been great
rev2-6324230681142278360-00002 who lurches from one state hand out to the next
rev2-6324230681142278360-00006 there's no doubt about it
rev2-6324230681142278360-00007 this is all very promising
rev2-6324230681142278360-00009 i can't say i do
rev2-6324230681142278360-00010 apart from anything else
rev2-6324230681142278360-00013 i was just thinking what an eventful day it's been
rev2-6324230681142278360-00016 we could be very happy together
rev2-6324698403080812792-00002 how waterproof they are
rev2-6324698403080812792-00005 they share a lot of the same design and technology as high performance running shoes
rev2-6324698403080812792-00010 i'm doing ok here
rev2-6324698403080812792-00011 and you send that to the factory
rev2-6324698403080812792-00013 was broken in the 1850s when the industrial revolution came to
rev2-6324698403080812792-00014 so shoes today could end up in a high street in workington down the road
rev2-6324698403080812792-00015 or fifth avenue
rev2-6324698403080812792-00016 i loved that they were really pretty and delicate
rev2-6324698403080812792-00017 how do they make them
rev2-6324698403080812792-00021 what does it like
rev2-6324698403080812792-00022 in the afternoon
rev2-6324698403080812792-00023 you might get one size
rev2-6324698403080812792-00024 you'll buy a perfect shoe that fits
rev2-6324698403080812792-00027 somewhere in the world
rev2-6324698403080875597-00006 helping all those people
rev2-6324698403080875597-00007 don't worry about it
rev2-6324713864963081921-00001 it dwarfs anything we have in britain
rev2-6324713864963081921-00006 the reason travelling seems so seamless is because of all the efforts that go on behind the scenes
rev2-6324713864963081921-00008 in 70 million square feet of office space
rev2-6324713864963081921-00011 they've just completed the main stage of construction
rev2-6324713864963081921-00013 some items are held for three months
rev2-6324713864963081921-00014 we're running about 1
rev2-6324713864963081921-00015 200 people all day
rev2-6324713864963081921-00016 and then at our season
rev2-6324713864963081921-00017 which is between thanksgiving and christmas
rev2-6324713864963081921-00019 when things are good
rev2-6324713864963081921-00021 at the end of the day
rev2-6324713864963081921-00024 it depends on the drivers
rev2-6324713864963081921-00026 mighty oaks will grow
rev2-6324764116080445123-00001 he still had a chance of not surviving this injury
rev2-6324764116080445123-00004 even if we restart the heart
rev2-6324764116080445123-00005 but from the ecg changes and looking at david
rev2-6324764116080445123-00006 he's got chest pain
rev2-6324764116080445123-00007 it is the giving of an anaesthetic drug and a paralytic
rev2-6324764116080445123-00008 because his heart is still struggling to work
rev2-6324764116080445123-00010 every bump is caused by something else
rev2-6324764116080445123-00011 and you need to piece together all those bits
rev2-6324764116080445123-00012 at the base of the brain
rev2-6324764116080445123-00013 pushing the spinal cord across
rev2-6324764116080445123-00014 then it will be damaging the cord
rev2-6324764116080445123-00017 from that point
rev2-6324764116080445123-00018 if you press enough on that
rev2-6324764116080445123-00019 if you act quickly enough
rev2-6324764116080445123-00020 pulled him out and done exactly the same thing
rev2-6325119739372550419-00005 they share a lot of the same design and technology as high performance running shoes
rev2-6325119739372550419-00014 was broken in the 1850s when the industrial revolution came to
rev2-6325119739372550419-00015 or fifth avenue
rev2-6325119739372550419-00016 i loved that they were really pretty and delicate
rev2-6325119739372550419-00017 how do they make them
rev2-6325119739372550419-00021 what does it like
rev2-6325119739372550419-00022 in the afternoon
rev2-6325119739372550419-00023 you might get one size
rev2-6325119739372550419-00024 you'll buy a perfect shoe that fits
rev2-6325119739372550419-00026 my shoes are behind there
rev2-6325119739372550419-00027 somewhere in the world
rev2-6325440573560032726-00001 on there as well
rev2-6325440573560032726-00002 that is incredible
rev2-6325440573560032726-00003 i think it was even more of a momentous event
rev2-6325440573560032726-00005 people with no money at all
rev2-6325440573560032726-00006 or next to no money
rev2-6325440573560032726-00007 when you came into contact with the state
rev2-6325440573560032726-00008 the post office apart
rev2-6325440573560032726-00009 right up to the 20th century
rev2-6325440573560032726-00011 or tell you what to do
rev2-6325440573560032726-00012 or take some of your money or all these kinds of things
rev2-6325440573560032726-00015 so all these dozens
rev2-6325440573560032726-00016 this is what will benefit
rev2-6325440573560032726-00018 so we work in tandem with each other because they come in obviously to post their parcels
rev2-6325440573560032726-00021 but you remember the old days in the post office
rev2-6325440573560032726-00022 this used to be called the post office's best kept secret
rev2-6325440573560032726-00025 so they can come down
rev2-6325440573560032726-00026 cos i had the heaviest delivery in europe
rev2-6325440573560032726-00027 so each one 40 pounds
rev2-6325440573560032726-00028 the post office
rev2-6325440573560032726-00029 it's a wonderful
rev2-6325440573560032726-00030 but it's backward looking
rev2-6325440573560032726-00031 i want to meet all of the director generals and i want to hear about what they do
rev2-6325440573560032726-00032 so he was restless
rev2-6325440573560032726-00034 do you want to come with me
rev2-6325440573560032726-00035 and we went to trafalgar square and
rev2-6325440573560032726-00036 if he hadn't been postmaster general
rev2-6325440573560032726-00038 wilson had talked in 63 about the white heat of technology and dad was
rev2-6325456035311830751-00002 mexico doesn't generate all that much good press overseas
rev2-6325456035311830751-00005 but i suppose some of my children will become prime minister instead
rev2-6325456035311830751-00006 by all reckoning
rev2-6325456035311830751-00007 it's not even a joke
rev2-6325456035311830751-00013 it's not the door
rev2-6325456035311830751-00017 any slaughterhouse is a lot worse i guess than what we're seeing here
rev2-6325796196721673967-00005 because they add that nice bit of structure
rev2-6325796196721673967-00007 hopefully over time
rev2-6325796196721673967-00009 this is perfect for taking advantage of vertical space like a boundary
rev2-6325796196721673967-00010 these are beautiful
rev2-6325796196721673967-00011 using meadow turf
rev2-6325819389545137915-00001 when i was a child
rev2-6325819389545137915-00002 the only thing that would get me to sleep was my parents reading me the takeaway menu from our
rev2-6325819389545137915-00003 something like that
rev2-6325819389545137915-00004 i don't think she's
rev2-6325819389545137915-00005 at the age of seven
rev2-6325819389545137915-00008 i want you to come to my bedroom
rev2-6325819389545137915-00010 my name is carlos
rev2-6325819389545137915-00011 and the bull's eyes
rev2-6325819389545137915-00012 they say you to be at least a minimum standard
rev2-6325819389545137915-00013 and to prove it
rev2-6325894121976022773-00003 i generally feel safe
rev2-6325894121976022773-00004 you need a bike that's convenient
rev2-6325894121976022773-00005 suddenly appears when you want it
rev2-6325894121976022773-00006 disappears when you don't want it
rev2-6325894121976022773-00008 but that's nothing compared to the price of some of the racing bikes
rev2-6325894121976022773-00009 they can cost up to 10
rev2-6325894121976022773-00010 but you don't have to spend a lot of money to pedal faster
rev2-6325894121976022773-00011 other tyres on other bikes
rev2-6325894121976022773-00013 when you order a bike from this factory
rev2-6325894121976022773-00014 you get a standard saddle but if you really want luxury for your bottom
rev2-6325894121976022773-00016 to make sure it's all right
rev2-6326360555424366722-00003 autumn coming in
rev2-6326360555424366722-00004 where it'll be fine as long as it's in water
rev2-6326360555424366722-00006 and i have got the effect i want
rev2-6326360555424366722-00007 and over the next four weeks
rev2-6326360555424366722-00008 dna testing allows us to identify exactly which group a plant belongs to
rev2-6326360555424366722-00009 but very few are
rev2-6326360555424366722-00012 with an odd sprinkling of annuals
rev2-6326360555424366722-00013 and one of the things that i like to do first
rev2-6326360555424366722-00014 and that keeps them dry
rev2-6326360555424366722-00016 not least cos the ground is often very hard
rev2-6326360555424366722-00017 because you can create the right conditions for it in the pot
rev2-6326360555424366722-00018 it also means if you don't have a garden
rev2-6326360555424366722-00019 you can have a fabulous spring display
rev2-6326360555424366722-00020 like goat droppings
rev2-6326360555424366722-00021 these have been in here for a couple of hours
rev2-6326360555424366722-00022 overnight is perfect
rev2-6326360555424366722-00024 and that's because
rev2-6326360555424366722-00025 like many neighbourhoods around the country
rev2-6326360555424366722-00026 it's had its difficulties
rev2-6326360555424366722-00028 the chance of me experiencing jungle is not very high
rev2-6326360555424366722-00029 i'm able to create
rev2-6326360555424366722-00030 tropical and unusual
rev2-6326360555424366722-00034 i thought that was something i really had to go and see
rev2-6326360555424366722-00037 i always made a beeline for decimus burton's palm house
rev2-6326360555424366722-00038 much better effect
rev2-6326360555424366722-00039 seven or nine stems
rev2-6326360555424366722-00040 no more than that
rev2-6326360555424366722-00041 and that will give you better flower spikes
rev2-6326360555424366722-00042 this main spike will lean over and split the crown at the bottom
rev2-6326360555424366722-00043 it could have as much as 30 or 40 little stems
rev2-6326360555424366722-00044 they're potential flowers
rev2-6326360555424366722-00045 because they're lovely plants
rev2-6326360555424366722-00047 they will always give you pleasure
rev2-6326360555424366722-00048 and they're tough
rev2-6326360555424366722-00050 it's wet and it's cold in winter
rev2-6326360555424366722-00051 they will last the winter they are hardy
rev2-6326360555424366722-00052 after all and then they've got a head start and will grow away next spring
rev2-6326360555424366722-00054 he has won many gold medals from chelsea and is a very
rev2-6326414672012357313-00001 view your property
rev2-6326414672012357313-00002 did today's buyers do their homework
rev2-6326414672012357313-00004 so much work needs to be done
rev2-6326414672012357313-00005 it certainly needs a lot of renovation
rev2-6326414672012357313-00006 everything needs doing
rev2-6326414672012357313-00011 you want to go to a certain level
rev2-6326414672012357313-00013 and it will still suit the needs and the requirements of that family
rev2-6326414672012357313-00014 so in that sense
rev2-6326414672012357313-00015 because you have to take this house back to the bare brick
rev2-6326414672012357313-00016 that's a relatively small budget
rev2-6326414672012357313-00017 the builders we use here in margate were originally a family we housed in london who came from very
rev2-6326414672012357313-00018 who ends up getting the house and how well it's done
rev2-6326414672012357313-00019 michael has a team of builders all ready to go
rev2-6326414672012357313-00021 but if you're not scared off by the state of the place and you pay near the guide price
rev2-6326414672012357313-00022 he's got a tenant already lined up waiting to move in
rev2-6326414672012357313-00023 will things run to plan
rev2-6326414672012357313-00024 will they stick to their budget
rev2-6326414672012357313-00025 there could be some room for some profit here
rev2-6326414672012357313-00028 anybody else can join in
rev2-6326414672012357313-00030 third and final time
rev2-6326414672012357313-00031 that's just one of the things in the grounds
rev2-6326414672012357313-00035 right by the side
rev2-6326414672012357313-00037 what can you do about it
rev2-6326414672012357313-00040 this area of cornwall
rev2-6326414672012357313-00041 famous for its mining in the past
rev2-6326414672012357313-00042 it's got three reception rooms
rev2-6326414672012357313-00043 six seven bedrooms upstairs
rev2-6326414672012357313-00044 it should sell in the region of 450
rev2-6326414672012357313-00046 if you were to build
rev2-6326414672012357313-00047 so even if there was a collapse situation
rev2-6326414672012357313-00049 how are they going to get on
rev2-6326414672012357313-00051 there is the development potential on the plot
rev2-6326414672012357313-00052 on the negative side
rev2-6326414672012357313-00053 a normal rabbit
rev2-6326414672012357313-00056 other than that
rev2-6326414672012357313-00058 it's really nice
rev2-6326414672012357313-00060 you never know quite what to bid to
rev2-6326414672012357313-00061 but now that the work's been done
rev2-6326414672012357313-00062 about three and a half miles from the nearest town of belper
rev2-6326414672012357313-00064 and before that
rev2-6326414672012357313-00066 and i think for that 80
rev2-6326414672012357313-00069 it won't appeal to everybody
rev2-6326414672012357313-00072 so not a good start
rev2-6326414672012357313-00073 so move into while i'm doing the work
rev2-6326414672012357313-00074 nice windows with a view out the front
rev2-6326414672012357313-00075 cos i'm home based
rev2-6326414672012357313-00080 you can find out later in the show
rev2-6326414672012357313-00083 did today's buyers finish their projects or was time their enemy
rev2-6326414672012357313-00085 we would look to market the property at an asking price in the region of 385
rev2-6326414672012357313-00086 it was a bit tired
rev2-6326414672012357313-00087 i think it's beautifully presented
rev2-6326414672012357313-00089 000 mark with a view to returning about 160
rev2-6326461057659161695-00005 but this family are spending so much
rev2-6326461057659161695-00008 she knows that she can't get to the paralympics
rev2-6326461057659161695-00009 train like that
rev2-6326461057659161695-00010 and eat stuff out of pots that you pour boiling water over
rev2-6326461057659161695-00011 thank you very much
rev2-6326461057659161695-00013 that tastes really clean and fresh
rev2-6326461057659161695-00015 after five years
rev2-6326461057659161695-00016 being catered for
rev2-6326461057659161695-00018 we set you a target of 3
rev2-6326461057659161695-00019 big fan of the brands and convenience food
rev2-6326538367070482119-00001 are we being duped
rev2-6326538367070482119-00002 until about three on one occasion
rev2-6326538367070482119-00004 and it is enormous
rev2-6326553828952690654-00001 i have long been an earnest advocate of closer ties between our two countries
rev2-6326553828952690654-00002 we will receive on united states soil
rev2-6326553828952690654-00003 we should pursue this strategy
rev2-6326553828952690654-00006 if entrusted to our navies
rev2-6326553828952690654-00007 as much information as your acts would allow us to have in advance of you getting the weapon into
rev2-6326553828952690654-00011 they don't want it
rev2-6326553828952690654-00012 the police tactics
rev2-6326553828952690654-00015 into one particular programme
rev2-6326553828952690654-00016 which is always dangerous for any politician
rev2-6326553828952690654-00017 5 billion into it already
rev2-6326553828952690654-00018 what is really meant by the words
rev2-6326553828952690654-00020 the uk wants a nuclear force
rev2-6326553828952690654-00023 if you're not prepared to provide us with polaris
rev2-6326866932068565154-00001 life expectancy could be as low as 40 years
rev2-6326866932068565154-00002 original ideas and i'm sorry
rev2-6326866932068565154-00005 they should be able to rise to the challenge and show us they can work with a raw material and make
rev2-6326866932068565154-00008 and men were encouraged to keep fit
rev2-6326866932068565154-00012 because this is all about being eclectic
rev2-6326866932068565154-00015 if a homeowner asks for contemporary
rev2-6326866932068565154-00016 i want to see that she can deliver that
rev2-6326990627126693682-00003 what we're looking for is whipped
rev2-6326990627126693682-00004 and that's part of the problem
rev2-6326990627126693682-00005 when it is simple
rev2-6326990627126693682-00006 i'm a pretty skilled baker
rev2-6327199362537275576-00005 and lighting your way to the future
rev2-6327199362537275576-00007 i'm happy to say
rev2-6327199362537275576-00008 but your candlestick was an enormous success
rev2-6327199362537275576-00017 but you were right to call me
rev2-6327295999301439627-00001 95 of people do
rev2-6327295999301439627-00005 if you don't do it
rev2-6327295999301439627-00009 you've got that wonderful sage
rev2-6327295999301439627-00011 it's not somewhere out of harry potter
rev2-6327295999301439627-00012 it's just up the road from kingy's house
rev2-6327295999301439627-00014 and a visit is well worth it
rev2-6327295999301439627-00018 like a language
rev2-6327295999301499598-00001 i wouldn't recommend jumping out of a cake
rev2-6327295999301499598-00003 my day already feels rather overwhelming
rev2-6327295999301499598-00004 in times of great stress and confusion
rev2-6327295999301499598-00005 i'd say there ought to be less of it
rev2-6327295999301499598-00007 for your information
rev2-6327295999301499598-00008 probably best take care of yourself
rev2-6327295999301499598-00010 a splenic artery aneurysm repair
rev2-6327570447711650000-00004 have you no feelings
rev2-6327570447711650000-00005 you've been robbed
rev2-6327609102417316299-00002 it existed in a time warp
rev2-6327609102417316299-00004 take all the nutrients and energy back into the soil where it can be used by the plants again to
rev2-6327609102417316299-00006 all these plants would die
rev2-6327609102417316299-00010 maybe some disturbed vegetation
rev2-6327609102417316299-00011 thick bamboo breaks
rev2-6327609102417316299-00012 it's really hard to stay quiet around here
rev2-6327713470253076639-00001 then they can be re buried with all the dignity they deserve
rev2-6327713470253076639-00002 we would probably have a different national identity
rev2-6327713470253076639-00004 and if they do turn out to be those of alfred
rev2-6327713470253076639-00007 but that was only the start of the story
rev2-6327713470253076639-00009 so in honour of his father
rev2-6327713470253076639-00011 just four years after his burial
rev2-6327713470253076639-00012 by the 9th century
rev2-6327713470253076639-00016 but they were soon enthusiastic about making pilgrimages to rome
rev2-6327713470253076639-00017 alfred's father was no exception and he sent young alfred on two visits to the city
rev2-6327713470253076639-00018 the first in 853 when the boy was just four years old
rev2-6327713470253076639-00019 these visits to the most impressive and powerful city in the western world made a huge impression
rev2-6327713470253076639-00020 and over time it became a permanent saxon base
rev2-6327713470253076639-00021 praying for the protection of the city as he did so
rev2-6327713470253076639-00022 it shaped his thinking as an adult
rev2-6327713470253076639-00023 because he was to grow into a committed
rev2-6327713470253076639-00024 this may have been a special ceremony to honour a son of the royal house of wessex
rev2-6327713470253076639-00025 whatever it really meant
rev2-6327713470253076639-00026 that dominated the landscape
rev2-6327713470253076639-00027 carrying the remains of king alfred
rev2-6327713470253076639-00028 her mother was a member of the mercian royal family
rev2-6327713470253076639-00029 causes severe stomach pain
rev2-6327713470253076639-00030 experts have suggested that the ailment that stuck him down
rev2-6327713470253076639-00031 and affected him for years to come
rev2-6327713470253076639-00032 guthrum and his men mounted a surprise attack
rev2-6327713470253076639-00033 alfred had fought alongside his brothers so he was no stranger to the battlefield
rev2-6327713470253076639-00038 eventually becoming lord chancellor himself
rev2-6327713470253076639-00039 and he made his name helping henry resolve one of the greatest crises of his reign
rev2-6327713470253076639-00040 and all the while
rev2-6327713470253076639-00042 but they're made even more so when you realise that all of this was put in place as part of a
rev2-6327713470253076639-00048 he was also careful to keep half the men in reserve
rev2-6327713470253076639-00049 grimbald from france and
rev2-6327713470253076639-00050 according to howard
rev2-6327713470253076639-00051 the keeper of the jail was a man by the name of mr page
rev2-6327713470253076639-00052 and mr page told him that in advance of the building work
rev2-6327713470253076639-00053 that's 38 in today's money
rev2-6327713470253076639-00054 the reverend william williams
rev2-6327713470253076639-00055 because we only have that one piece
rev2-6327713470253076639-00058 to do further excavation on this site to see what else is turned up
rev2-6327713470253076639-00062 but it's another very important step
rev2-6327740528416575363-00001 all doing it for a living
rev2-6327740528416575363-00003 because they are next
rev2-6327740528416575363-00004 and that's how they do it
rev2-6327740528416575363-00005 that kind of entices the general managers into thinking
rev2-6327740528416575363-00006 wages and salaries are about 900 billion
rev2-6327740528416575363-00007 although four billion sounds a huge amount of money
rev2-6327740528416575363-00008 it comes either from the owners of companies
rev2-6327740528416575363-00009 the negative effect is that people might in the end find getting jobs much more difficult
rev2-6327740528416575363-00010 not because they're thrown out of work because of the minimum wage
rev2-6327740528416575363-00011 with clean sheets
rev2-6327740528416575363-00012 is part and parcel of working in housekeeping
rev2-6327740528416575363-00013 let me finish now
rev2-6327740528416575363-00015 this is getting your rejects
rev2-6327740528416575363-00017 we want to work
rev2-6327740528416575363-00019 and in this hotel
rev2-6327740528416575363-00020 if i'm being honest
rev2-6327740528416575363-00021 and i don't think we should have to live like that
rev2-6327740528416575363-00022 not when he works so hard
rev2-6327740528416575363-00023 i think i'm a lot bigger in personality
rev2-6327740528416575363-00024 do you think in certain sectors it keeps the wages down because migrants are prepared to work for
rev2-6327740528416575363-00025 they do say that migration has kept a downward pressure on wages in
rev2-6327740528416575363-00026 who may think that those jobs aren't the kind of jobs they want to do
rev2-6327740528416575363-00027 but i think that rather than think
rev2-6327740528416575363-00028 the problem is migration and therefore we should stop that
rev2-6327740528416575363-00036 because people come here
rev2-6327740528416575363-00037 they want to work
rev2-6327740528416575363-00038 they will then pay taxes
rev2-6327740528416575363-00039 i used to have people for dinner once a week
rev2-6327941532886024424-00001 the safer society will be
rev2-6327941532886024424-00002 full of contrition
rev2-6327941532886024424-00006 you realise what this means
rev2-6327980187591690710-00003 that will be really helpful
rev2-6328038169780654524-00001 many of them left from here in southampton
rev2-6328038169780654524-00003 the valentines' six cylinder diesel engines roared into life
rev2-6328038169780654524-00004 with the canvas screens providing little
rev2-6328038169780654524-00005 protection from the incoming waves
rev2-6328038169780654524-00008 what it would have been like for someone like frank
rev2-6328038169780654524-00009 eight ounces of gunpowder
rev2-6328038169780654524-00010 brown paper bag
rev2-6328038169780654524-00012 small explosives could be detonated to break off the tail section
rev2-6328038169780654524-00013 technology was the silent ally
rev2-6328038169780654524-00014 it paved the way for men to fight on the beaches of normandy
rev2-6328111613590949805-00003 who is an expert in york
rev2-6328111613590949805-00004 it says it there
rev2-6328111613590949805-00006 someone called wimpy klop
rev2-6328111613590949805-00009 can we get the owners to agree
rev2-6328111613590949805-00010 so after the second world war
rev2-6328111613590949805-00012 and get the money
rev2-6328111613590949805-00013 we call him the old general
rev2-6328111613590949805-00015 he was staying with them
rev2-6328111613590949805-00016 normally what we would do is we would package up this information and we would present it to a
rev2-6328111613590949805-00017 in this litigious environment in the united states
rev2-6328111613590949805-00018 what worries people is being sued
rev2-6328111613590949805-00019 and what difference would it make to you if we could prove it
rev2-6328111613590949805-00021 so quite a long time ago
rev2-6328111613590949805-00023 it's always going to raise questions
rev2-6328111613590949805-00024 it's from bruce kaiser
rev2-6328111613590949805-00025 i would guess the probability of this occurring randomly approaches the same probability of someone
rev2-6328111613590949805-00026 using the same paint in exactly the same way
rev2-6328111613590949805-00027 if we can do that
rev2-6328111613590949805-00029 the sad fact is you may not own this picture
rev2-6328111613590949805-00030 because even if there is confusion about the ownership
rev2-6328312618060398848-00009 thank you for supporting my malvolio
rev2-6328312618060398848-00010 photography is very much part of show business
rev2-6328312618060398848-00011 if the royal shakespeare company give me suitable parts
rev2-6328351272766065122-00002 especially mammal life
rev2-6328351272766065122-00003 but working as a team
rev2-6328351272766065122-00006 why is it so valuable
rev2-6328351272766065122-00007 when the scales became in great demand for asian wildlife trade
rev2-6328393792942295524-00001 spend some time making sure we get it exactly right
rev2-6328393792942295524-00002 it's much better because you don't create landfill and you're reusing what you've got about
rev2-6328393792942295524-00003 it's five to one
rev2-6328393792942295524-00004 which means it's five sand to one cement
rev2-6328393792942295524-00005 so there doesn't need to be a layer of hardcore beneath the cement and brick
rev2-6328393792942295524-00006 and my grandma and my grandad
rev2-6328393792942295524-00010 and birds actually like to be able to hop in and look around in a hedge
rev2-6328512334039666732-00003 is it possible to do that
rev2-6328512334039666732-00005 it's got to be the sugar in combination with other things
rev2-6328512334039666732-00007 when we are exposed to different things
rev2-6328512334039666732-00008 judging from today
rev2-6328512334039666732-00010 as ruth goodman's been learning
rev2-6328512334039666732-00012 stop consuming it
rev2-6328512334039666732-00013 with the entire industry based upon slavery
rev2-6328656644940810739-00006 they can come here and spend some time relaxing
rev2-6328656644940810739-00011 i'd rather be in josh's spot
rev2-6328764878116731644-00002 this is the show where all the questions have been asked to 100 people before the show
rev2-6328764878116731644-00003 and all our celebrities have to do is come up with the answers that none of those 100 people could
rev2-6328764878116731644-00005 each of our celebrities is playing for a nominated charity
rev2-6328764878116731644-00007 we just had a ball
rev2-6328764878116731644-00008 let's just talk about m people
rev2-6328764878116731644-00010 a lot of people
rev2-6328764878116731644-00013 let's change and get back to gardening as well
rev2-6328764878116731644-00014 who was your drummer
rev2-6328764878116731644-00019 six on the second
rev2-6328764878116731644-00021 let's play our five little tracks and here they are
rev2-6328764878116731644-00022 and it's a multisensory centre for people with special needs
rev2-6328764878116731644-00023 which is the twins and multiple births association and they actually helped me and gave me lots of
rev2-6328764878116731644-00025 if it's right and it's pointless
rev2-6328764878116731644-00028 this has to be pointless for you to win that jackpot
rev2-6328764878116731644-00029 as today's show is a celebrity special
rev2-6328764878116731644-00030 join us next time
rev2-6328764878116731644-00031 when we'll be putting more obscure knowledge to the test on pointless
rev2-6328764878116731644-00032 and playing us out with moving on up
rev2-6328962017115556355-00001 so that's a very healthy young plant
rev2-6328962017115556355-00002 instead of being opposite one another
rev2-6328962017115556355-00003 we're used to crab apples being big fruit
rev2-6328962017115556355-00004 which are about three or four years older
rev2-6328962017115556355-00007 some of my favourite fruits
rev2-6328962017115556355-00009 they store the damp
rev2-6328962017115556355-00010 i just keep trying different stuff and the stuff that works and looks right
rev2-6328962017115556355-00011 because that's it
rev2-6329054788409218032-00003 ten favourite dishes that i cook
rev2-6329054788409218032-00004 i don't fancy that
rev2-6329054788409218032-00008 so i hope that he does like it
rev2-6329054788409218032-00016 they did amazingly well
rev2-6329054788409218032-00017 they're eating healthier
rev2-6329062519350282760-00002 because using vegetables in a dessert has become more popular nowadays
rev2-6329062519350282760-00006 but anything can happen with dessert
rev2-6329062519350282760-00008 he's got 15 minutes left to go
rev2-6329062519350282760-00009 his ice cream is not even in the machine
rev2-6329062519350282760-00011 regardless of their background
rev2-6329062519350282760-00013 right hand out to shake
rev2-6329062519350282760-00014 and then step back
rev2-6329062519350282760-00016 through to the judges
rev2-6329062519350282760-00017 i didn't want to be going home on thursday
rev2-6329151425173313518-00001 i know i don't sound it
rev2-6329151425173313518-00002 but i'm a scot by birth
rev2-6329151425173313518-00003 for what it's worth
rev2-6329151425173313518-00004 it was rather male
rev2-6329151425173313518-00005 it felt slightly dark
rev2-6329151425173313518-00006 it was fiercely pro british unionist and it was mildly conservative
rev2-6329151425173313518-00007 in every possible cultural way
rev2-6329151425173313518-00010 where women seem to be running almost everything and which is
rev2-6329151425173313518-00011 so the question is very straightforward and simple to pose
rev2-6329151425173313518-00013 the scottish conservative and unionist party
rev2-6329151425173313518-00015 an achievement that would stand for half a century to come
rev2-6329151425173313518-00016 the tories then could have called themselves the party of scotland
rev2-6329151425173313518-00017 back in the day
rev2-6329151425173313518-00018 there were lots of small businesses
rev2-6329151425173313518-00023 and all these industries
rev2-6329151425173313518-00024 which had a great past
rev2-6329151425173313518-00025 the tories got the blame for that
rev2-6329151425173313518-00026 you also became
rev2-6329151425173313518-00029 and they were immensely proud of the ships they sent down the clyde
rev2-6329151425173313518-00030 many of them royal naval ships
rev2-6329151425173313518-00031 and if you weren't labour
rev2-6329151425173313518-00033 the women in the scheme in old monkland
rev2-6329151425173313518-00034 that i was born and brought up in
rev2-6329151425173313518-00035 they were at the doors because this was a girl from coatbridge going to the uni
rev2-6329151425173313518-00036 the end of heavy industry on the clyde and so forth
rev2-6329151425173313518-00037 people had to move away
rev2-6329151425173313518-00039 what scotland now is
rev2-6329151425173313518-00040 produces a post industrial politics
rev2-6329151425173313518-00041 what does that mean
rev2-6329151425173313518-00042 going to this school
rev2-6329151425173313518-00043 therefore i vote for that party
rev2-6329151425173313518-00044 which gave them power at the heart of the labour party and therefore at westminster
rev2-6329151425173313518-00046 she was an attractive woman
rev2-6329151425173313518-00047 could sustain itself
rev2-6329151425173313518-00049 ladies and gentlemen
rev2-6329151425173313518-00051 i stand before you
rev2-6329151425173313518-00054 and if you wish it
rev2-6329151425173313518-00055 even in the 1979 general election
rev2-6329151425173313518-00056 margaret thatcher's great triumph
rev2-6329151425173313518-00057 labour in scotland had a clear majority
rev2-6329151425173313518-00058 44 out of 71 of the available seats
rev2-6329151425173313518-00061 you something something lunatic
rev2-6329151425173313518-00062 if they push on with the unacceptable proposals of recent years
rev2-6329151425173313518-00064 it looks from the latest figures
rev2-6329151425173313518-00066 then basically what was left tended to be non catholic
rev2-6329151425173313518-00067 who set up the adam smith institute subsequently
rev2-6329151425173313518-00068 even more important
rev2-6329151425173313518-00071 when the big state was at its biggest
rev2-6329151425173313518-00072 just two years before she was forced from power
rev2-6329151425173313518-00074 perhaps it would be best
rev2-6329151425173313518-00075 but first they had to believe in wealth creation
rev2-6329151425173313518-00076 otherwise where did the money come from
rev2-6329151425173313518-00077 and they had to believe in original sin
rev2-6329151425173313518-00078 and that they should look after their own families first and they should not depend on high
rev2-6329151425173313518-00079 scots had had enough of what they regarded as margaret thatcher's grating
rev2-6329151425173313518-00080 that perfectly manicured fingernail jabbing at them
rev2-6329151425173313518-00081 the churchmen made it clear they were distinctly unamused
rev2-6329151425173313518-00082 they spoke for many scots
rev2-6329151425173313518-00085 but they're predictable conservative attacks
rev2-6329151425173313518-00086 the randomness of human life is very
rev2-6329151425173313518-00087 we would not have lived through new labour
rev2-6329151425173313518-00088 more than 22 years on
rev2-6329151425173313518-00090 the tories would have been different
rev2-6329151425173313518-00092 over domestic affairs
rev2-6329151425173313518-00093 in the 1970s had been a dominant issue in the politics of the labour government at that time
rev2-6329151425173313518-00095 part of every one of us
rev2-6329151425173313518-00096 and we respect it
rev2-6329151425173313518-00098 if there are any
rev2-6329151425173313518-00099 but especially in the local areas
rev2-6329151425173313518-00100 that didn't mean it wasn't successful in scotland
rev2-6329151425173313518-00101 while you had much
rev2-6329151425173313518-00102 much disillusionment with the labour party in scotland
rev2-6329151425173313518-00103 and i think that is
rev2-6329151425173313518-00104 a combination of that
rev2-6329151425173313518-00105 because people in scotland wanted a parliament
rev2-6329151425173313518-00107 because people wanted
rev2-6329151425173313518-00108 scotland wanted a scottish parliament and therefore
rev2-6329151425173313518-00111 where people want a greater sense of identity
rev2-6329151425173313518-00112 look for identity
rev2-6329151425173313518-00113 where identity politics is much more important
rev2-6329151425173313518-00114 whether it's uk and brussels
rev2-6329151425173313518-00115 or whether it's
rev2-6329151425173313518-00116 legal and decisive
rev2-6329151425173313518-00117 in the coming days
rev2-6329151425173313518-00118 and i think then we need to move forward and say
rev2-6329151425173313518-00119 if there are problems of uncertainty and lack of clarity
rev2-6329151425173313518-00120 and i don't think we should just let this go on year after year
rev2-6329835613463566698-00001 tell me what would you do
rev2-6329835613463566698-00002 would you buy this
rev2-6329835613463566698-00005 this is quite a bold project and yet you don't seem remotely fazed by any of it
rev2-6329835613463566698-00007 maybe that's incredibly naive of me but i just think it will be ok and it will all work out
rev2-6329835613463566698-00011 imagine the kind of farmer who has leisure time
rev2-6329835613463566698-00014 in the section about the dudleston farms
rev2-6329835613463566698-00015 once we get over these issues
rev2-6329835613463566698-00017 these actually carry the sashes and the weights in here
rev2-6329835613463566698-00018 we can't finish our structural phase of our mortgage
rev2-6329835613463566698-00020 which we don't need
rev2-6329835613463566698-00021 she wants them to read
rev2-6329835613463566698-00022 at the end of the day
rev2-6329835613463566698-00023 we can say it wasn't in budget but it needs to be done
rev2-6329835613463566698-00024 it's got a missing tooth
rev2-6329835613463566698-00025 he also founded the local grammar school
rev2-6329835613463566698-00026 the grant was obtained under which was founded the royal free grammar school of shrewsbury
rev2-6329835613463566698-00027 who is that person
rev2-6329893595522062514-00003 me and my best mate
rev2-6329893595522062514-00004 not for any other reason
rev2-6329893595522062514-00005 i'm not doing it
rev2-6329893595522062514-00006 i'm not flaming going in the transport that he's organised
rev2-6329893595522062514-00007 what is the plural for mecca
rev2-6329893595522062514-00009 at the same level of their profession
rev2-6329893595522062514-00010 three michelin stars
rev2-6329893595522122781-00002 it's all been fairly recent
rev2-6329893595522122781-00005 it's not diabetes
rev2-6329893595522122781-00006 it's not an infection
rev2-6329893595522122781-00007 it's not a stroke
rev2-6329893595522122781-00008 i feel like we're running out of time
rev2-6329893595522122781-00010 normal antibody levels
rev2-6329893595522122781-00011 similar partial paralysis
rev3-6300370419826092098-00001 so we need you to help us in our revival campaign
rev3-6300370419826092098-00002 or into vodka and adding a bit of honey
rev3-6300370419826092098-00003 those should have rooted
rev3-6300370419826092098-00004 maybe in a greenhouse
rev3-6300370419826092098-00006 versatile plant with so many great uses
rev3-6300370419826092098-00007 i think they're an important part of our heritage and one that we should be proud to revive
rev3-6300370419826092098-00010 but the gardens have been swept away by later monarchs demonstrating later
rev3-6300370419826092098-00012 that's the point
rev3-6300370419826092098-00013 so they look radically different but their origins are actually from the same place
rev3-6300370419826092098-00014 what are the key practicalities
rev3-6300370419826092098-00016 they look fantastic
rev3-6300370419826092098-00018 which gives me a very instantly recognisable design
rev3-6300370419826092098-00020 crunchy lettuce but
rev3-6300370419826092098-00024 they're very low maintenance
rev3-6300370419826092098-00025 they offer year round structure and the design
rev3-6301320037095305408-00002 the gist of it is
rev3-6301320037095305408-00003 i'll have it all squared
rev3-6301320037095305408-00004 just when you think you're having the worst day possible
rev3-6301320037095305408-00006 that kit has to be here at 11 o'clock
rev3-6301320037095305408-00007 all those people want to take my picture
rev3-6301320037095305408-00009 if you don't go under again
rev3-6301320037095305408-00010 like i never do
rev3-6302978323968228875-00005 even if it's only a single one
rev3-6302978323968228875-00007 and for the customers
rev3-6302978323968228875-00008 don't bring tom
rev3-6302978323968228875-00010 why did you bring me in here
rev3-6302978323968228875-00011 whether you've got a window box
rev3-6302978323968228875-00012 whether you've got a hanging basket
rev3-6302978323968228875-00013 if you soak the flowers of this they've just come out the greenhouse you'll end up blemishing the
rev3-6302978323968228875-00015 without people like yourselves
rev3-6302978323968228875-00016 the pelargonium industry
rev3-6302978323968228875-00017 you've been sniffing those geranium leaves
rev3-6302978323968228875-00019 not just in the uk
rev3-6302978323968228875-00020 but in the world
rev3-6302978323968228875-00021 between four to six weeks' time and by the end of this season
rev3-6302978323968228875-00022 september or october
rev3-6302978323968228875-00023 very nice looking plant by early autumn and then you're multiplying your favourite
rev3-6303167732026041278-00001 the majestic kirby hall in northamptonshire
rev3-6303167732026041278-00004 also wanted the queen to come and stay at his house
rev3-6303167732026041278-00005 let's talk about them
rev3-6303167732026041278-00006 under the glass domes
rev3-6303167732026041278-00007 possibly even into the early part of the 20th century
rev3-6303167732026041278-00011 but was in need of some serious tlc
rev3-6303167732026041278-00013 i wasn't given it
rev3-6303167732026041278-00014 i was virtually given it
rev3-6303167732026041278-00017 there was no paint in the way that we understand it
rev3-6303167732026041278-00018 and single objects that are found in this way
rev3-6303167732026041278-00019 are very seldom viewed as treasure trove
rev3-6303167732026041278-00023 in its day it was home to sumptuous wealth and sir christopher hatton
rev3-6306811582279909115-00001 and it was once voted the most haunted house in britain
rev3-6306811582279909115-00003 more than 400 years later
rev3-6306811582279909115-00004 on the anniversary of her death
rev3-6306811582279909115-00005 it's said her headless ghost arrives here in a carriage driven by headless horses and a headless
rev3-6306811582279909115-00006 i'll be back here to find out what really goes on behind the closed doors of this beautiful and
rev3-6306811582279909115-00007 you might consider house hunting in norfolk
rev3-6306811582279909115-00009 making homes in this lovely county incredible value for those seeking a rural retreat
rev3-6306811582279909115-00010 which is great news for today's buyers
rev3-6306811582279909115-00011 we have the seaside
rev3-6306811582279909115-00012 you're both retired
rev3-6306811582279909115-00013 there are some converted barns
rev3-6306811582279909115-00014 and the same person that converted those built this house in the same style
rev3-6306811582279909115-00015 because nigel was so stern about the budget
rev3-6306811582279909115-00018 that's my whole life sorted
rev3-6306811582279909115-00019 and it really is all she ever talks about
rev3-6306811582279909115-00021 and then had it built
rev3-6306811582279909115-00022 i think it's a gorgeous place
rev3-6306811582279909115-00023 it was on the market for 450
rev3-6306811582279909115-00025 with the other homes
rev3-6306811582279909115-00026 we've tried to accommodate the family that they're going to be leaving behind
rev3-6306811582279909115-00027 but the mystery house
rev3-6306811582279909115-00030 the question is
rev3-6306811582279909115-00033 it really was the perfect home for them and the family
rev3-6306811582279909115-00034 it had everything they asked for
rev3-6306811582279909115-00035 and even though he needs some time
rev3-6306870852828565379-00002 in the fairy tales
rev3-6306870852828565379-00004 in making people think that they had a common german heritage to look back
rev3-6306870852828565379-00006 according to my guidebook
rev3-6306870852828565379-00007 occupations are chiefly with timber
rev3-6306870852828565379-00008 was heard in these valleys
rev3-6306870852828565379-00010 eastern railways were still advertising trips to germany and 6
rev3-6306870852828565379-00013 thoughts about the beauty of nature
rev3-6306870852828565379-00014 now it's surrounded by the skyscrapers of the modern city of frankfurt
rev3-6306870852828565379-00015 there were three stations before that
rev3-6306870852828565379-00016 i love to stay in a traditional hotel
rev3-6306870852828565379-00017 that's the impression many people have
rev3-6306870852828565379-00018 and the problem is people don't really understand that much about economics
rev3-6306870852828565379-00019 where he was born in 1749
rev3-6306870852828565379-00021 by your language
rev3-6306870852828565379-00022 i think without the burschenschaften
rev3-6306870852828565379-00023 for the first time in the world
rev3-6306870852828565379-00024 you're blowing air between these two points
rev3-6306870852828565379-00026 models of trains
rev3-6306870852828565379-00027 amongst the many german states that had been overrun by the french emperor napoleon and whose
rev3-6306870852828565379-00028 there arose the idea of creating a nation
rev3-6306870852828565379-00029 germany was a great power
rev3-6308177381880006979-00001 the writing garden which
rev3-6308177381880006979-00002 is mainly white
rev3-6308177381880006979-00004 but i do want to share and celebrate the animals that are enjoying it
rev3-6308177381880006979-00005 but the flowers are over now
rev3-6308177381880006979-00006 doesn't look good
rev3-6308177381880006979-00007 not much else is getting a benefit from it
rev3-6308177381880006979-00008 even though you can't see it
rev3-6308177381880006979-00010 but i think it can be done
rev3-6308177381880006979-00011 when you're planting for bees in particular
rev3-6308177381880006979-00012 but insects in general
rev3-6308177381880006979-00013 it's covering what i'm doing now
rev3-6308177381880006979-00017 so that should anything happen in one area where the plants were displayed
rev3-6308177381880006979-00022 but not until you've done these jobs for the weekend
rev3-6308177381880006979-00024 not least from the building and grounds
rev3-6308177381880006979-00026 i don't flood them every now and then and let them dry out
rev3-6308177381880006979-00027 grow them on and you'll be harvesting them in late september and october
rev3-6308177381880006979-00028 as the only female in a hard
rev3-6308312673349834578-00004 wombats are like little bulldozers
rev3-6308312673349834578-00008 this is the kangaroo bible
rev3-6308312673349834578-00010 i give him a teddy bear or a punching bag
rev3-6308312673349834578-00013 it's a good feeling
rev3-6309468449049188125-00004 it's gone from tired and old
rev3-6309468449049188125-00006 and he's old school
rev3-6309468449049188125-00007 and he's going to turn those battered old doors into something saleable
rev3-6309468449049188125-00016 chunky bits of timber
rev3-6309468449049188125-00017 and they are really rough and ready
rev3-6309468449049188125-00018 it's going to be a lot of work
rev3-6309468449049188125-00020 with a new baby on the way
rev3-6309468449049188125-00021 that 99 will definitely come in handy
rev3-6309468449049188125-00024 norman has made something really beautiful with those old scraps
rev3-6309468449049188125-00026 we've handed over a little bit of money along the way
rev3-6309824072341293478-00001 i'm ted and i'm studying to become a barrister
rev3-6309824072341293478-00002 very much we practised for it
rev3-6309824072341293478-00004 i don't know anything about ella eyre but on the basis that ellie goulding definitely had an album
rev3-6309824072341293478-00005 i guess i'll go for her
rev3-6309824072341293478-00007 i think it's a white cross on a blue background
rev3-6309824072341293478-00008 this is what we have been playing towards
rev3-6309824072341293478-00009 it is time for the final round
rev3-6309824072341293478-00010 i have read about him
rev3-6310166810731517953-00002 they talk a lot about the feel of natural energy in an arena
rev3-6310166810731517953-00005 as far as vienna at one time
rev3-6310166810731517953-00007 probably been at the heart of human affairs
rev3-6310166810731517953-00009 for new generation and new age
rev3-6310166810731517953-00011 i don't remember
rev3-6310166810731517953-00014 all of these troglodyte caves everywhere and the nice landscape
rev3-6310166810731517953-00015 many years later
rev3-6310166810731517953-00016 because it was empty
rev3-6310166810731517953-00017 when i was a little child
rev3-6310166810731517953-00025 so it's against islamic law
rev3-6310166810731517953-00026 i'm really not a good muslim person
rev3-6310195157515669986-00001 the show where a team of five quiz challengers pit their wits against possibly the greatest quiz
rev3-6310195157515669986-00002 i'm kim and i'm an ncs recruitment officer
rev3-6310195157515669986-00004 that was brilliant
rev3-6310195157515669986-00005 i'm katherine and i'm a mentoring coordinator
rev3-6310195157515669986-00006 so it's a round
rev3-6310195157515669986-00008 nothing at all is coming
rev3-6310195157515669986-00009 wouldn't it be nice to get on with me neighbours
rev3-6310195157515669986-00010 i can't even think of a sensible answer
rev3-6310195157515669986-00011 i do know it when i heard the answer
rev3-6310195157515669986-00012 i know the song
rev3-6310195157515669986-00014 but i thought 40
rev3-6310195157515669986-00015 it's time for the final round
rev3-6310195157515669986-00016 so on that basis
rev3-6310195157515669986-00017 so we're going to go with royal standard
rev3-6310968251628953184-00001 and they might not even make it through the first battle
rev3-6310968251628953184-00002 ladies and gentlemen
rev3-6310968251628953184-00010 it may not look anything like it does now
rev3-6310968251628953184-00011 or did to start the fight
rev3-6310968251628953184-00014 and had a look at what was remaining
rev3-6310968251628953184-00018 for the last time tonight
rev3-6311014637275749987-00001 sports is once again hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons
rev3-6311014637275749987-00002 you get them in the post
rev3-6311014637275749987-00003 with that much at stake
rev3-6311014637275749987-00007 and then the shame
rev3-6311014637275749987-00012 ask him what he's taking
rev3-6311014637275749987-00013 how he's taking them
rev3-6311014637275749987-00014 who's he get them off
rev3-6311014637275749987-00018 and then when i met natalie
rev3-6311014637275749987-00025 and there are people who will say
rev3-6311014637275749987-00026 he only got into that much trouble because he took too much
rev3-6311014637275749987-00027 but that definitely isn't true
rev3-6311014637275749987-00028 these are dangerous drugs
rev3-6311014637275749987-00029 they just want to look better
rev3-6311014637275749987-00030 male pattern baldness
rev3-6311014637275749987-00031 impaired erectile function
rev3-6311014637275749987-00032 and in about 10 of the cases
rev3-6311014637275749987-00033 the cells die prematurely
rev3-6311014637275749987-00034 the longer that you have been taking your steroids
rev3-6311014637275749987-00035 it would be very worrying
rev3-6311014637275749987-00036 because this would mean that men who take steroids over long periods of time might be at greater
rev3-6311014637275749987-00037 and that the vast majority of cigarette smokers were still under the age of 50 now
rev3-6311014637275749987-00038 in that scenario
rev3-6311014637275749987-00039 the occasional report of emphysema
rev3-6311014637275749987-00040 the heart in fact is the strongest muscle in the body
rev3-6311014637275749987-00041 and it's the only muscle that never rests
rev3-6311014637275749987-00043 they have not gone through clinical trials
rev3-6311014637275749987-00044 and yet their use does not exist in the shadows
rev3-6311014637275749987-00046 but these new molecules have never been approved for human use
rev3-6311014637275749987-00047 it's not a big statistical trial
rev3-6311014637275749987-00048 i think because i
rev3-6311014637275749987-00049 like everyone else
rev3-6311014637275749987-00050 would like to look a bit better and would like a magic injection to do it
rev3-6311014637275749987-00051 but this is not the way
rev3-6311014637275749987-00052 these are dangerous drugs
rev3-6311014637275749987-00053 you're on all these dosages
rev3-6311014637275749987-00054 how do you feel
rev3-6311014637275749987-00055 that i've got a tummy
rev3-6311014637275749987-00056 which means that they have to tell us where they're available to be tested every single day of the
rev3-6311014637275749987-00057 and i was immediately
rev3-6311014637275749987-00058 the day that paper came out
rev3-6311014637275749987-00060 i had no idea that was coming
rev3-6311014637275749987-00063 and at that point
rev3-6311014637275749987-00064 if you're anything like me
rev3-6311014637275749987-00066 i've roped in my identical twin brother
rev3-6311014637275749987-00068 so what were going to be doing is passing a very mild electrical current over an area of the brain
rev3-6311014637275749987-00069 maybe a slight burning
rev3-6311280066254641716-00006 is covered with paintings
rev3-6311280066254641716-00010 trying to find direction
rev3-6311280066254641716-00013 how much has romania changed
rev3-6311651151429016127-00001 there was one house on this grand and elegant street where you never wanted to end up
rev3-6311651151429016127-00003 but you also have to remember the location of hungary
rev3-6311651151429016127-00004 where we are located
rev3-6311651151429016127-00014 much more independent
rev3-6311651151429016127-00015 this is the levadia palace
rev3-6311651151429016127-00018 and many of them have positive
rev3-6311651151429016127-00019 nice memories of the soviet days
rev3-6312022236603390541-00004 and they think that tradition's not necessary
rev3-6312022236603390541-00008 because this is
rev3-6312022236603390541-00009 so it was very exciting
rev3-6312022236603390541-00010 that's for our president
rev3-6312022236603390541-00012 as well as russian academy of science
rev3-6312066045269810824-00004 met irving while he was in new york city
rev3-6312066045269810824-00006 they raised their glasses and the toast was
rev3-6312066045269810824-00007 down with the train
rev3-6312066045269810824-00008 and a whole budget of others
rev3-6312066045269810824-00010 as any cadet at the academy could tell you
rev3-6312066045269810824-00012 is one of the most attractive places on the river and the seat of the national military academy
rev3-6312066045269810824-00015 without a doubt
rev3-6312066045269810824-00016 it came close to almost destroying this nation
rev3-6312066045269810824-00017 31 years on active duty as a colonel
rev3-6312066045269810824-00021 having come to know a little bit about this mighty river
rev3-6312066045269810824-00022 i personally would always choose a railway line
rev3-6312066045269810824-00023 going back to that to try to form a stronger american identity when so many things are being
rev3-6312066045269810824-00026 new york made a statement
rev3-6312066045269810824-00027 it will be the largest and most splendid edifice in america
rev3-6312066045269810824-00028 we're a lot different than other states in terms of our philosophy
rev3-6313565847849574520-00003 50 of the robots gone at the very
rev3-6313565847849574520-00006 and we will follow them
rev3-6313565847849574520-00013 for the last time tonight
rev3-6313656042293295351-00001 my father went to west africa
rev3-6313656042293295351-00003 i'd never seen a black man
rev3-6313656042293295351-00004 to the best of my recollection
rev3-6313656042293295351-00007 and the medical officer might have been your father
rev3-6313656042293295351-00008 it might have been on its own in europe
rev3-6313656042293295351-00009 but it had a vast empire
rev3-6313656042293295351-00012 in the deepest jungle
rev3-6313656042293295351-00014 they've been likened to the battle of stalingrad and the battle of el alamein and midway as
rev3-6313656042293295351-00016 saw that it no longer had the strategic value it had
rev3-6313656042293295351-00018 those fatal shots
rev3-6313877662475262663-00001 things didn't really get much better
rev3-6313877662475262663-00005 they know of python
rev3-6313877662475262663-00012 we're building a house now in the forest
rev3-6313877662475262663-00013 which is coming on very nicely
rev3-6313877662475262663-00015 and we have a lovely daughter whose name actually by the way is chelsea
rev3-6313877662475262663-00016 that's the best that i could ever wish them
rev3-6313877662475262663-00017 i think i can see where you're coming from asking that question
rev3-6313877662475262663-00018 as a brave nation that however has something to offer here and now
rev3-6313877662475262663-00028 what about your love life here
rev3-6313877662475262663-00030 this is a scheduled service
rev3-6313877662475262663-00033 i've great respect for these guys
rev3-6313877662475262663-00034 but it was a great run
rev3-6313877662475262663-00039 and it's really hard physical work
rev3-6313936933024013236-00002 exercise is a waste of time
rev3-6313936933024013236-00004 congratulations about the baby
rev3-6313936933024013236-00006 i was all right in the end
rev3-6313936933024013236-00008 it was a one off
rev3-6313936933024013236-00009 it was a one off
rev3-6313936933024013236-00011 but you have to understand
rev3-6313936933024013236-00014 and phil wouldn't tell me anything
rev3-6314248747649637090-00002 000 foot mountain range in the heart of europe
rev3-6314248747649637090-00003 but these are the high tatras
rev3-6314248747649637090-00004 part of the carpathian range
rev3-6314248747649637090-00009 i think czechs are very social
rev3-6314248747649637090-00013 i guess it was a larger community
rev3-6314248747649637090-00014 not everything was wrong
rev3-6314248747649637090-00015 some people still have the wall in their heads
rev3-6314248747649637090-00017 what people plan
rev3-6314248747649637090-00018 so what was shocking for him was the result
rev3-6314308018198387664-00001 and i may be no action woman
rev3-6314308018198387664-00002 you may find him
rev3-6314308018198387664-00005 are you eating properly
rev3-6314308018198387664-00006 and if he improves
rev3-6314308018198387664-00007 i want to isolate a patient from exposure to the wi fi
rev3-6314308018198387664-00008 if your symptoms fade while you're in here
rev3-6314308018198387664-00009 we're looking back at how sport and music came together in the 80s to create some amazing and some
rev3-6314619832824012968-00002 the portuguese who followed him found indigenous people here
rev3-6314619832824012968-00004 cotton and tobacco that they set up
rev3-6314619832824012968-00007 but it's low tide
rev3-6314619832824012968-00010 this is very powerful
rev3-6314619832824012968-00011 so i might find out something very unpleasant
rev3-6314619832824012968-00012 because i'm going to something
rev3-6314619832824012968-00015 you have to run
rev3-6314990917998387385-00003 there's no road access at all
rev3-6314990917998387385-00004 i'm heading south now
rev3-6314990917998387385-00006 in brazil as well
rev3-6314990917998387385-00007 still we're very
rev3-6315050188547072188-00003 before the railways
rev3-6315050188547072188-00011 the railway lines could then ship it back to the ports
rev3-6315050188547072188-00014 it's a really good
rev3-6315405811839181004-00002 lots of outlying farms and a small collection of buildings
rev3-6315405811839181004-00003 thousands of tonnes of ammunition
rev3-6315405811839181004-00004 so his troops were very hungry
rev3-6315405811839181004-00005 so they ate what they could and
rev3-6315405811839181004-00006 whatever they couldn't carry off
rev3-6315405811839181004-00007 the confederate commander
rev3-6315405811839181004-00008 a lot of people consider that one of his greatest victories because he drove the union army from
rev3-6315405811839181004-00009 but i think it's important that when we look back on that and take a certain pride in that that we
rev3-6315405811839181004-00010 it was founded in 1727 and contains about 6
rev3-6315405811839181004-00011 an ideal place for me to begin to discover the spirit of the
rev3-6315405811839181004-00012 when i'm going to sit down in the evening with a nice glass of bourbon
rev3-6315405811839181004-00018 wondering if they're doing it correctly
rev3-6315405811839181004-00019 we didn't see any of that with you
rev3-6315405811839181004-00021 after two months of active debating
rev3-6315405811839181004-00022 88 voted to secede
rev3-6315405811839181004-00023 i feel much that makes me feel at home
rev3-6315405811839181004-00026 what was that saying
rev3-6315405811839181004-00027 that was saying that
rev3-6315405811839181004-00029 tell me about that
rev3-6315405811839181004-00031 it wasn't even close to the uss monitor
rev3-6315405811839181004-00033 only one turret
rev3-6315405811839181004-00034 virtually every major combat vessel that was designed
rev3-6315405811839181004-00035 not only the american navy
rev3-6315405811839181004-00036 but in navy's around the world after the battle of hampton roads
rev3-6315405811839181004-00037 they were new vessels
rev3-6315405811839181004-00041 during the revolution
rev3-6315405811839181004-00042 we see ourselves as something else
rev3-6315405811839181004-00043 later in their history
rev3-6315405811839181004-00044 they didn't much like being told by yankees that they shouldn't own slaves
rev3-6315405811839181004-00045 to use the term
rev3-6315405811839181004-00046 you know that doesn't go very well
rev3-6315405811839181004-00047 when john smith returns to england 1609
rev3-6315405811839181004-00049 and that never works out well
rev3-6315405811839181004-00050 that there are great chunks of virginian history that i did not know
rev3-6315405811839181004-00051 it's kind of overshadowed by massachusetts
rev3-6315405811839181004-00052 after the south lost the war in our civil war
rev3-6315405811839181004-00053 where the indians and the pilgrims sat down together
rev3-6315421273721446605-00002 to get through to the next stage
rev3-6315421273721446605-00003 do go to our website
rev3-6315421273721446605-00006 thanks for watching
rev3-6316024287129869379-00001 more and more people would love to have their own property portfolio
rev3-6316024287129869379-00002 then at least you'd have your foot on the property developing ladder
rev3-6316024287129869379-00003 i've never seen a house like this
rev3-6316024287129869379-00007 it sort of works
rev3-6316024287129869379-00010 made in a local factory
rev3-6316024287129869379-00011 the minton factory
rev3-6316024287129869379-00012 but you've got to be very
rev3-6316024287129869379-00013 we looked at a load of houses in the university area
rev3-6316024287129869379-00014 i work part time
rev3-6316024287129869379-00016 they seem to be as sad as i will be to see this floor in the back go
rev3-6316024287129869379-00017 but they mean noise and traffic
rev3-6316024287129869379-00018 the road itself is attractive
rev3-6316024287129869379-00023 that is what lets this flat down
rev3-6316024287129869379-00024 i'd expect to get 1
rev3-6316024287129869379-00027 long gap with trying to sort out the paperwork
rev3-6316024287129869379-00028 i don't think john will have the same problem here
rev3-6316024287129869379-00029 where will john decide he wants the wet room
rev3-6316024287129869379-00030 will their friendship survive this tooting transformation
rev3-6316024287129869379-00032 i wasn't having it
rev3-6316024287129869379-00035 about quarter of a mile from the metro station
rev3-6316024287129869379-00038 so added to all the other things you're going to do to this property
rev3-6316024287129869379-00040 the overall size of it
rev3-6316024287129869379-00042 i'm sure it generated a lot of interest when it went under the hammer
rev3-6316024287129869379-00045 if this is a business
rev3-6316024287129869379-00047 time has passed
rev3-6316024287129869379-00048 paul and andy have got themselves a great property here
rev3-6316024287129869379-00049 and they're making the slight error of not costing in their own time and effort which
rev3-6316163444070195447-00001 they're both still working right now
rev3-6316163444070195447-00007 he's driving well
rev3-6316163444070195447-00008 it's normally something simple
rev3-6318761040290818803-00009 so we're really happy that we got to do that
rev3-6318761040290818803-00012 the flipper was only firing at half power in the last fight
rev3-6318761040290818803-00013 as well as being cold
rev3-6318761040290818803-00019 not just robots
rev3-6318761040290818803-00021 we couldn't have imagined ten
rev3-6318761040290818803-00022 and the price of sensors
rev3-6318761040290818803-00023 and even the house robots aren't safe
rev3-6318761040290818803-00024 for the final time tonight
rev3-6318761040290818803-00026 that's what we do
rev3-6321358636511442057-00002 used it very intelligently
rev3-6321358636511442057-00003 by running away
rev3-6321358636511442057-00004 getting it up to speed and making the attack at the right precise moment
rev3-6321358636511442057-00005 you might have a really nice well engineered machine
rev3-6321358636511442057-00006 ready for the next battle
rev3-6321358636511442057-00008 it was not a knockout
rev3-6321358636511442057-00010 the gas system was misbehaving
rev3-6321358636511442057-00015 even though it lasted the whole three minutes
rev3-6321358636511442057-00017 but who will win
rev3-6322100806860254619-00006 i give you guy self
rev3-6322100806860254619-00008 even when it wasn't his fault
rev3-6322100806860254619-00009 family of my own
rev3-6323198600501050831-00003 it's freezing cold
rev3-6323198600501050831-00006 just loved the lifestyle
rev3-6323198600501050831-00007 working these antisocial hours
rev3-6323198600501050831-00008 there is some health risk
rev3-6323198600501050831-00013 the final test for our final four
rev3-6323198600501050831-00016 and make no mistake
rev3-6323198600501050831-00017 as long as you have got the right training to do the job
rev3-6323198600501050831-00018 you've got the right tools to do the job
rev3-6323198600501050831-00019 you know exactly what's being monitored and why and you know how you can influence that
rev3-6323198600501050831-00020 they might suffer from low self esteem
rev3-6323198600501050831-00022 it's interesting that
rev3-6323198600501050831-00023 when you make monitoring more intense
rev3-6323198600501050831-00024 i don't think we are
rev3-6323198600501050831-00025 and if we want a prosperous
rev3-6323198600501050831-00027 and often in sort of a capacity of care
rev3-6323198600501050831-00029 new jobs do arise
rev3-6323198600501050831-00030 new jobs are created
rev3-6323198600501050831-00032 i think i could live on the minimum wage
rev3-6323198600501050831-00033 that was two reasons
rev3-6323198600501050831-00037 all i've known is farming
rev3-6323221793324446979-00001 look at other gardens
rev3-6323221793324446979-00002 planted in winter
rev3-6323221793324446979-00004 and after last summer's disaster with my grapes
rev3-6323221793324446979-00005 what with wasps and blackbirds
rev3-6323221793324446979-00007 you can simply cut the whole lot flush with the ground round about christmas time and let it start
rev3-6323221793324446979-00008 because there is an element of skill involved
rev3-6323221793324446979-00011 produce their fruit on this year's canes
rev3-6323221793324446979-00012 so it is a job to do
rev3-6323221793324446979-00013 because you don't want more than four or five canes per plant
rev3-6323221793324446979-00015 and so probably my grandfather
rev3-6323221793324446979-00016 who was brought up there
rev3-6323221793324446979-00017 from the same canes
rev3-6323221793324446979-00018 a few years ago
rev3-6323221793324446979-00022 because we think jekyll did it all remotely
rev3-6323221793324446979-00025 and then as autumn comes and it goes
rev3-6323221793324446979-00026 the broccoli can take over the whole space
rev3-6323221793324446979-00028 and by the end of the season it's right up here
rev3-6323221793324446979-00029 and on top of that
rev3-6323221793324446979-00032 i grow vegetables because i like the taste
rev3-6323221793324446979-00035 comparing the two different locations with same varieties
rev3-6323221793324446979-00039 this is hundreds and thousands
rev3-6323221793324446979-00041 so please put any pictures you can on our facebook page
rev3-6323221793324446979-00042 but you've got a bank holiday weekend coming up
rev3-6323221793324446979-00043 so extra time to do extra jobs in the garden
rev3-6323221793324446979-00044 great wasps' nest
rev3-6323221793324446979-00045 which means you stay away
rev3-6323221793324446979-00048 and good flavour this year
rev3-6323817075791736335-00002 will they sink or swim
rev3-6323817075791736335-00010 depending on the age
rev3-6323817075791736335-00013 it's all over the walls
rev3-6323817075791736335-00015 will it have too much of a stigma attached to it
rev3-6323817075791736335-00020 talk me through the two options
rev3-6323817075791736335-00024 i've got the monies in place
rev3-6323817075791736335-00026 he's got the money to complete on the purchase
rev3-6323817075791736335-00028 will he get the planning permission
rev3-6323817075791736335-00029 will he get it sorted out
rev3-6323817075791736335-00030 you can find out later in the show
rev3-6323817075791736335-00032 although in this case
rev3-6323817075791736335-00033 if you're intent on recouping the cash and pocketing the profit
rev3-6323817075791736335-00034 you may very well end up disappointed
rev3-6323817075791736335-00038 this house is probably worth around 120
rev3-6323817075791736335-00041 on paper and in theory
rev3-6323817075791736335-00042 the problem that you're likely to face is actually selling the thing
rev3-6323817075791736335-00046 then you can tell me to shut up
rev3-6323817075791736335-00049 that's fair enough
rev3-6323817075791736335-00050 you have got a great work ethic and
rev3-6323817075791736335-00051 any profit is a profit
rev3-6323817075791736335-00053 some profit is much
rev3-6323817075791736335-00054 much better than none
rev3-6323817075791736335-00055 i'm also pleased he'll consider renting
rev3-6323817075791736335-00056 i just hope whoever bought it was prepared to keep hold
rev3-6323817075791736335-00057 000 on this property
rev3-6323817075791736335-00063 so it would be more sought after
rev3-6323817075791736335-00064 i was expecting around the 70
rev3-6323817075791736335-00065 i have spent a lot of money on these flats
rev3-6323817075791736335-00066 get me money back in the pot
rev3-6323817075791736335-00067 and it gets better
rev3-6323817075791736335-00072 especially the ground floor
rev3-6323817075791736335-00073 whether they be sold or let
rev3-6323817075791736335-00074 it has been done to a high standard
rev3-6323817075791736335-00075 especially for first time buyers
rev3-6323817075791736335-00085 but there's still planning issues to resolve and will he be able to sell the properties
rev3-6323817075791736335-00101 i would suggest that he rents each property out at between 500 and
rev3-6323817075791736335-00106 in order to achieve that
rev3-6323956232732063947-00005 it's a tough fight
rev3-6323956232732063947-00011 all of the robots out there full of energy
rev3-6323956232732063947-00013 we could have flipped them at one point
rev3-6323956232732063947-00017 we can still do it
rev3-6323956232732063947-00019 it healed its scars
rev3-6323956232732063947-00020 this is the final i would have asked for
rev3-6323956232732063947-00022 the teams are ready
rev3-6323956232732063947-00023 for the last time this series
rev3-6323956232732126743-00002 the people of tewkesbury
rev3-6323956232732126743-00003 that came to 483
rev3-6323956232732126743-00004 within two years
rev3-6323956232732126743-00005 and has been turned into a bangle
rev3-6323956232732126743-00006 which in many ways is very wearable
rev3-6323956232732126743-00007 which is not particularly bad news
rev3-6323956232732126743-00008 which is beautiful
rev3-6323956232732126743-00009 that is the designer
rev3-6323956232732126743-00010 but then here on this side
rev3-6323956232732126743-00012 it's after galle's death
rev3-6323956232732126743-00013 but it's still a stunning thing
rev3-6323956232732126743-00014 they are holding that
rev3-6323956232732126743-00016 and i saw this in an auction in australia
rev3-6323956232732126743-00017 they've been in england
rev3-6323956232732126743-00018 there was the father of ornithology
rev3-6323956232732126743-00019 so it was a process partly of print
rev3-6323956232732126743-00020 and if we turn this one round
rev3-6323956232732126743-00024 which was designed in 1900
rev3-6323956232732126743-00025 they were there for espionage
rev3-6323956232732126743-00027 my parents had it before i was born
rev3-6323956232732126743-00028 i was brought up with it
rev3-6323956232732126743-00029 and it is just so remarkably stylish
rev3-6323956232732126743-00030 just look at it
rev3-6323956232732126743-00032 like never before
rev3-6323956232732126743-00034 it's been great
rev3-6324230681142278360-00002 who lurches from one state hand out to the next
rev3-6324230681142278360-00006 there's no doubt about it
rev3-6324230681142278360-00007 this is all very promising
rev3-6324230681142278360-00009 i can't say i do
rev3-6324230681142278360-00010 apart from anything else
rev3-6324230681142278360-00013 i was just thinking what an eventful day it's been
rev3-6324230681142278360-00016 we could be very happy together
rev3-6324698403080812792-00002 how waterproof they are
rev3-6324698403080812792-00005 they share a lot of the same design and technology as high performance running shoes
rev3-6324698403080812792-00010 i'm doing ok here
rev3-6324698403080812792-00011 and you send that to the factory
rev3-6324698403080812792-00013 was broken in the 1850s when the industrial revolution came to
rev3-6324698403080812792-00014 so shoes today could end up in a high street in workington down the road
rev3-6324698403080812792-00015 or fifth avenue
rev3-6324698403080812792-00016 i loved that they were really pretty and delicate
rev3-6324698403080812792-00017 how do they make them
rev3-6324698403080812792-00021 what does it like
rev3-6324698403080812792-00022 in the afternoon
rev3-6324698403080812792-00023 you might get one size
rev3-6324698403080812792-00024 you'll buy a perfect shoe that fits
rev3-6324698403080812792-00027 somewhere in the world
rev3-6324698403080875597-00006 helping all those people
rev3-6324698403080875597-00007 don't worry about it
rev3-6324713864963081921-00001 it dwarfs anything we have in britain
rev3-6324713864963081921-00006 the reason travelling seems so seamless is because of all the efforts that go on behind the scenes
rev3-6324713864963081921-00008 in 70 million square feet of office space
rev3-6324713864963081921-00011 they've just completed the main stage of construction
rev3-6324713864963081921-00013 some items are held for three months
rev3-6324713864963081921-00014 we're running about 1
rev3-6324713864963081921-00015 200 people all day
rev3-6324713864963081921-00016 and then at our season
rev3-6324713864963081921-00017 which is between thanksgiving and christmas
rev3-6324713864963081921-00019 when things are good
rev3-6324713864963081921-00021 at the end of the day
rev3-6324713864963081921-00024 it depends on the drivers
rev3-6324713864963081921-00026 mighty oaks will grow
rev3-6324764116080445123-00001 he still had a chance of not surviving this injury
rev3-6324764116080445123-00004 even if we restart the heart
rev3-6324764116080445123-00005 but from the ecg changes and looking at david
rev3-6324764116080445123-00006 he's got chest pain
rev3-6324764116080445123-00007 it is the giving of an anaesthetic drug and a paralytic
rev3-6324764116080445123-00008 because his heart is still struggling to work
rev3-6324764116080445123-00010 every bump is caused by something else
rev3-6324764116080445123-00011 and you need to piece together all those bits
rev3-6324764116080445123-00012 at the base of the brain
rev3-6324764116080445123-00013 pushing the spinal cord across
rev3-6324764116080445123-00014 then it will be damaging the cord
rev3-6324764116080445123-00017 from that point
rev3-6324764116080445123-00018 if you press enough on that
rev3-6324764116080445123-00019 if you act quickly enough
rev3-6324764116080445123-00020 pulled him out and done exactly the same thing
rev3-6325119739372550419-00005 they share a lot of the same design and technology as high performance running shoes
rev3-6325119739372550419-00014 was broken in the 1850s when the industrial revolution came to
rev3-6325119739372550419-00015 or fifth avenue
rev3-6325119739372550419-00016 i loved that they were really pretty and delicate
rev3-6325119739372550419-00017 how do they make them
rev3-6325119739372550419-00021 what does it like
rev3-6325119739372550419-00022 in the afternoon
rev3-6325119739372550419-00023 you might get one size
rev3-6325119739372550419-00024 you'll buy a perfect shoe that fits
rev3-6325119739372550419-00026 my shoes are behind there
rev3-6325119739372550419-00027 somewhere in the world
rev3-6325440573560032726-00001 on there as well
rev3-6325440573560032726-00002 that is incredible
rev3-6325440573560032726-00003 i think it was even more of a momentous event
rev3-6325440573560032726-00005 people with no money at all
rev3-6325440573560032726-00006 or next to no money
rev3-6325440573560032726-00007 when you came into contact with the state
rev3-6325440573560032726-00008 the post office apart
rev3-6325440573560032726-00009 right up to the 20th century
rev3-6325440573560032726-00011 or tell you what to do
rev3-6325440573560032726-00012 or take some of your money or all these kinds of things
rev3-6325440573560032726-00015 so all these dozens
rev3-6325440573560032726-00016 this is what will benefit
rev3-6325440573560032726-00018 so we work in tandem with each other because they come in obviously to post their parcels
rev3-6325440573560032726-00021 but you remember the old days in the post office
rev3-6325440573560032726-00022 this used to be called the post office's best kept secret
rev3-6325440573560032726-00025 so they can come down
rev3-6325440573560032726-00026 cos i had the heaviest delivery in europe
rev3-6325440573560032726-00027 so each one 40 pounds
rev3-6325440573560032726-00028 the post office
rev3-6325440573560032726-00029 it's a wonderful
rev3-6325440573560032726-00030 but it's backward looking
rev3-6325440573560032726-00031 i want to meet all of the director generals and i want to hear about what they do
rev3-6325440573560032726-00032 so he was restless
rev3-6325440573560032726-00034 do you want to come with me
rev3-6325440573560032726-00035 and we went to trafalgar square and
rev3-6325440573560032726-00036 if he hadn't been postmaster general
rev3-6325440573560032726-00038 wilson had talked in 63 about the white heat of technology and dad was
rev3-6325456035311830751-00002 mexico doesn't generate all that much good press overseas
rev3-6325456035311830751-00005 but i suppose some of my children will become prime minister instead
rev3-6325456035311830751-00006 by all reckoning
rev3-6325456035311830751-00007 it's not even a joke
rev3-6325456035311830751-00013 it's not the door
rev3-6325456035311830751-00017 any slaughterhouse is a lot worse i guess than what we're seeing here
rev3-6325796196721673967-00005 because they add that nice bit of structure
rev3-6325796196721673967-00007 hopefully over time
rev3-6325796196721673967-00009 this is perfect for taking advantage of vertical space like a boundary
rev3-6325796196721673967-00010 these are beautiful
rev3-6325796196721673967-00011 using meadow turf
rev3-6325819389545137915-00001 when i was a child
rev3-6325819389545137915-00002 the only thing that would get me to sleep was my parents reading me the takeaway menu from our
rev3-6325819389545137915-00003 something like that
rev3-6325819389545137915-00004 i don't think she's
rev3-6325819389545137915-00005 at the age of seven
rev3-6325819389545137915-00008 i want you to come to my bedroom
rev3-6325819389545137915-00010 my name is carlos
rev3-6325819389545137915-00011 and the bull's eyes
rev3-6325819389545137915-00012 they say you to be at least a minimum standard
rev3-6325819389545137915-00013 and to prove it
rev3-6325894121976022773-00003 i generally feel safe
rev3-6325894121976022773-00004 you need a bike that's convenient
rev3-6325894121976022773-00005 suddenly appears when you want it
rev3-6325894121976022773-00006 disappears when you don't want it
rev3-6325894121976022773-00008 but that's nothing compared to the price of some of the racing bikes
rev3-6325894121976022773-00009 they can cost up to 10
rev3-6325894121976022773-00010 but you don't have to spend a lot of money to pedal faster
rev3-6325894121976022773-00011 other tyres on other bikes
rev3-6325894121976022773-00013 when you order a bike from this factory
rev3-6325894121976022773-00014 you get a standard saddle but if you really want luxury for your bottom
rev3-6325894121976022773-00016 to make sure it's all right
rev3-6326360555424366722-00003 autumn coming in
rev3-6326360555424366722-00004 where it'll be fine as long as it's in water
rev3-6326360555424366722-00006 and i have got the effect i want
rev3-6326360555424366722-00007 and over the next four weeks
rev3-6326360555424366722-00008 dna testing allows us to identify exactly which group a plant belongs to
rev3-6326360555424366722-00009 but very few are
rev3-6326360555424366722-00012 with an odd sprinkling of annuals
rev3-6326360555424366722-00013 and one of the things that i like to do first
rev3-6326360555424366722-00014 and that keeps them dry
rev3-6326360555424366722-00016 not least cos the ground is often very hard
rev3-6326360555424366722-00017 because you can create the right conditions for it in the pot
rev3-6326360555424366722-00018 it also means if you don't have a garden
rev3-6326360555424366722-00019 you can have a fabulous spring display
rev3-6326360555424366722-00020 like goat droppings
rev3-6326360555424366722-00021 these have been in here for a couple of hours
rev3-6326360555424366722-00022 overnight is perfect
rev3-6326360555424366722-00024 and that's because
rev3-6326360555424366722-00025 like many neighbourhoods around the country
rev3-6326360555424366722-00026 it's had its difficulties
rev3-6326360555424366722-00028 the chance of me experiencing jungle is not very high
rev3-6326360555424366722-00029 i'm able to create
rev3-6326360555424366722-00030 tropical and unusual
rev3-6326360555424366722-00034 i thought that was something i really had to go and see
rev3-6326360555424366722-00037 i always made a beeline for decimus burton's palm house
rev3-6326360555424366722-00038 much better effect
rev3-6326360555424366722-00039 seven or nine stems
rev3-6326360555424366722-00040 no more than that
rev3-6326360555424366722-00041 and that will give you better flower spikes
rev3-6326360555424366722-00042 this main spike will lean over and split the crown at the bottom
rev3-6326360555424366722-00043 it could have as much as 30 or 40 little stems
rev3-6326360555424366722-00044 they're potential flowers
rev3-6326360555424366722-00045 because they're lovely plants
rev3-6326360555424366722-00047 they will always give you pleasure
rev3-6326360555424366722-00048 and they're tough
rev3-6326360555424366722-00050 it's wet and it's cold in winter
rev3-6326360555424366722-00051 they will last the winter they are hardy
rev3-6326360555424366722-00052 after all and then they've got a head start and will grow away next spring
rev3-6326360555424366722-00054 he has won many gold medals from chelsea and is a very
rev3-6326414672012357313-00001 view your property
rev3-6326414672012357313-00002 did today's buyers do their homework
rev3-6326414672012357313-00004 so much work needs to be done
rev3-6326414672012357313-00005 it certainly needs a lot of renovation
rev3-6326414672012357313-00006 everything needs doing
rev3-6326414672012357313-00011 you want to go to a certain level
rev3-6326414672012357313-00013 and it will still suit the needs and the requirements of that family
rev3-6326414672012357313-00014 so in that sense
rev3-6326414672012357313-00015 because you have to take this house back to the bare brick
rev3-6326414672012357313-00016 that's a relatively small budget
rev3-6326414672012357313-00017 the builders we use here in margate were originally a family we housed in london who came from very
rev3-6326414672012357313-00018 who ends up getting the house and how well it's done
rev3-6326414672012357313-00019 michael has a team of builders all ready to go
rev3-6326414672012357313-00021 but if you're not scared off by the state of the place and you pay near the guide price
rev3-6326414672012357313-00022 he's got a tenant already lined up waiting to move in
rev3-6326414672012357313-00023 will things run to plan
rev3-6326414672012357313-00024 will they stick to their budget
rev3-6326414672012357313-00025 there could be some room for some profit here
rev3-6326414672012357313-00028 anybody else can join in
rev3-6326414672012357313-00030 third and final time
rev3-6326414672012357313-00031 that's just one of the things in the grounds
rev3-6326414672012357313-00035 right by the side
rev3-6326414672012357313-00037 what can you do about it
rev3-6326414672012357313-00040 this area of cornwall
rev3-6326414672012357313-00041 famous for its mining in the past
rev3-6326414672012357313-00042 it's got three reception rooms
rev3-6326414672012357313-00043 six seven bedrooms upstairs
rev3-6326414672012357313-00044 it should sell in the region of 450
rev3-6326414672012357313-00046 if you were to build
rev3-6326414672012357313-00047 so even if there was a collapse situation
rev3-6326414672012357313-00049 how are they going to get on
rev3-6326414672012357313-00051 there is the development potential on the plot
rev3-6326414672012357313-00052 on the negative side
rev3-6326414672012357313-00053 a normal rabbit
rev3-6326414672012357313-00056 other than that
rev3-6326414672012357313-00058 it's really nice
rev3-6326414672012357313-00060 you never know quite what to bid to
rev3-6326414672012357313-00061 but now that the work's been done
rev3-6326414672012357313-00062 about three and a half miles from the nearest town of belper
rev3-6326414672012357313-00064 and before that
rev3-6326414672012357313-00066 and i think for that 80
rev3-6326414672012357313-00069 it won't appeal to everybody
rev3-6326414672012357313-00072 so not a good start
rev3-6326414672012357313-00073 so move into while i'm doing the work
rev3-6326414672012357313-00074 nice windows with a view out the front
rev3-6326414672012357313-00075 cos i'm home based
rev3-6326414672012357313-00080 you can find out later in the show
rev3-6326414672012357313-00083 did today's buyers finish their projects or was time their enemy
rev3-6326414672012357313-00085 we would look to market the property at an asking price in the region of 385
rev3-6326414672012357313-00086 it was a bit tired
rev3-6326414672012357313-00087 i think it's beautifully presented
rev3-6326414672012357313-00089 000 mark with a view to returning about 160
rev3-6326461057659161695-00005 but this family are spending so much
rev3-6326461057659161695-00008 she knows that she can't get to the paralympics
rev3-6326461057659161695-00009 train like that
rev3-6326461057659161695-00010 and eat stuff out of pots that you pour boiling water over
rev3-6326461057659161695-00011 thank you very much
rev3-6326461057659161695-00013 that tastes really clean and fresh
rev3-6326461057659161695-00015 after five years
rev3-6326461057659161695-00016 being catered for
rev3-6326461057659161695-00018 we set you a target of 3
rev3-6326461057659161695-00019 big fan of the brands and convenience food
rev3-6326538367070482119-00001 are we being duped
rev3-6326538367070482119-00002 until about three on one occasion
rev3-6326538367070482119-00004 and it is enormous
rev3-6326553828952690654-00001 i have long been an earnest advocate of closer ties between our two countries
rev3-6326553828952690654-00002 we will receive on united states soil
rev3-6326553828952690654-00003 we should pursue this strategy
rev3-6326553828952690654-00006 if entrusted to our navies
rev3-6326553828952690654-00007 as much information as your acts would allow us to have in advance of you getting the weapon into
rev3-6326553828952690654-00011 they don't want it
rev3-6326553828952690654-00012 the police tactics
rev3-6326553828952690654-00015 into one particular programme
rev3-6326553828952690654-00016 which is always dangerous for any politician
rev3-6326553828952690654-00017 5 billion into it already
rev3-6326553828952690654-00018 what is really meant by the words
rev3-6326553828952690654-00020 the uk wants a nuclear force
rev3-6326553828952690654-00023 if you're not prepared to provide us with polaris
rev3-6326866932068565154-00001 life expectancy could be as low as 40 years
rev3-6326866932068565154-00002 original ideas and i'm sorry
rev3-6326866932068565154-00005 they should be able to rise to the challenge and show us they can work with a raw material and make
rev3-6326866932068565154-00008 and men were encouraged to keep fit
rev3-6326866932068565154-00012 because this is all about being eclectic
rev3-6326866932068565154-00015 if a homeowner asks for contemporary
rev3-6326866932068565154-00016 i want to see that she can deliver that
rev3-6326990627126693682-00003 what we're looking for is whipped
rev3-6326990627126693682-00004 and that's part of the problem
rev3-6326990627126693682-00005 when it is simple
rev3-6326990627126693682-00006 i'm a pretty skilled baker
rev3-6327199362537275576-00005 and lighting your way to the future
rev3-6327199362537275576-00007 i'm happy to say
rev3-6327199362537275576-00008 but your candlestick was an enormous success
rev3-6327199362537275576-00017 but you were right to call me
rev3-6327295999301439627-00001 95 of people do
rev3-6327295999301439627-00005 if you don't do it
rev3-6327295999301439627-00009 you've got that wonderful sage
rev3-6327295999301439627-00011 it's not somewhere out of harry potter
rev3-6327295999301439627-00012 it's just up the road from kingy's house
rev3-6327295999301439627-00014 and a visit is well worth it
rev3-6327295999301439627-00018 like a language
rev3-6327295999301499598-00001 i wouldn't recommend jumping out of a cake
rev3-6327295999301499598-00003 my day already feels rather overwhelming
rev3-6327295999301499598-00004 in times of great stress and confusion
rev3-6327295999301499598-00005 i'd say there ought to be less of it
rev3-6327295999301499598-00007 for your information
rev3-6327295999301499598-00008 probably best take care of yourself
rev3-6327295999301499598-00010 a splenic artery aneurysm repair
rev3-6327570447711650000-00004 have you no feelings
rev3-6327570447711650000-00005 you've been robbed
rev3-6327609102417316299-00002 it existed in a time warp
rev3-6327609102417316299-00004 take all the nutrients and energy back into the soil where it can be used by the plants again to
rev3-6327609102417316299-00006 all these plants would die
rev3-6327609102417316299-00010 maybe some disturbed vegetation
rev3-6327609102417316299-00011 thick bamboo breaks
rev3-6327609102417316299-00012 it's really hard to stay quiet around here
rev3-6327713470253076639-00001 then they can be re buried with all the dignity they deserve
rev3-6327713470253076639-00002 we would probably have a different national identity
rev3-6327713470253076639-00004 and if they do turn out to be those of alfred
rev3-6327713470253076639-00007 but that was only the start of the story
rev3-6327713470253076639-00009 so in honour of his father
rev3-6327713470253076639-00011 just four years after his burial
rev3-6327713470253076639-00012 by the 9th century
rev3-6327713470253076639-00016 but they were soon enthusiastic about making pilgrimages to rome
rev3-6327713470253076639-00017 alfred's father was no exception and he sent young alfred on two visits to the city
rev3-6327713470253076639-00018 the first in 853 when the boy was just four years old
rev3-6327713470253076639-00019 these visits to the most impressive and powerful city in the western world made a huge impression
rev3-6327713470253076639-00020 and over time it became a permanent saxon base
rev3-6327713470253076639-00021 praying for the protection of the city as he did so
rev3-6327713470253076639-00022 it shaped his thinking as an adult
rev3-6327713470253076639-00023 because he was to grow into a committed
rev3-6327713470253076639-00024 this may have been a special ceremony to honour a son of the royal house of wessex
rev3-6327713470253076639-00025 whatever it really meant
rev3-6327713470253076639-00026 that dominated the landscape
rev3-6327713470253076639-00027 carrying the remains of king alfred
rev3-6327713470253076639-00028 her mother was a member of the mercian royal family
rev3-6327713470253076639-00029 causes severe stomach pain
rev3-6327713470253076639-00030 experts have suggested that the ailment that stuck him down
rev3-6327713470253076639-00031 and affected him for years to come
rev3-6327713470253076639-00032 guthrum and his men mounted a surprise attack
rev3-6327713470253076639-00033 alfred had fought alongside his brothers so he was no stranger to the battlefield
rev3-6327713470253076639-00038 eventually becoming lord chancellor himself
rev3-6327713470253076639-00039 and he made his name helping henry resolve one of the greatest crises of his reign
rev3-6327713470253076639-00040 and all the while
rev3-6327713470253076639-00042 but they're made even more so when you realise that all of this was put in place as part of a
rev3-6327713470253076639-00048 he was also careful to keep half the men in reserve
rev3-6327713470253076639-00049 grimbald from france and
rev3-6327713470253076639-00050 according to howard
rev3-6327713470253076639-00051 the keeper of the jail was a man by the name of mr page
rev3-6327713470253076639-00052 and mr page told him that in advance of the building work
rev3-6327713470253076639-00053 that's 38 in today's money
rev3-6327713470253076639-00054 the reverend william williams
rev3-6327713470253076639-00055 because we only have that one piece
rev3-6327713470253076639-00058 to do further excavation on this site to see what else is turned up
rev3-6327713470253076639-00062 but it's another very important step
rev3-6327740528416575363-00001 all doing it for a living
rev3-6327740528416575363-00003 because they are next
rev3-6327740528416575363-00004 and that's how they do it
rev3-6327740528416575363-00005 that kind of entices the general managers into thinking
rev3-6327740528416575363-00006 wages and salaries are about 900 billion
rev3-6327740528416575363-00007 although four billion sounds a huge amount of money
rev3-6327740528416575363-00008 it comes either from the owners of companies
rev3-6327740528416575363-00009 the negative effect is that people might in the end find getting jobs much more difficult
rev3-6327740528416575363-00010 not because they're thrown out of work because of the minimum wage
rev3-6327740528416575363-00011 with clean sheets
rev3-6327740528416575363-00012 is part and parcel of working in housekeeping
rev3-6327740528416575363-00013 let me finish now
rev3-6327740528416575363-00015 this is getting your rejects
rev3-6327740528416575363-00017 we want to work
rev3-6327740528416575363-00019 and in this hotel
rev3-6327740528416575363-00020 if i'm being honest
rev3-6327740528416575363-00021 and i don't think we should have to live like that
rev3-6327740528416575363-00022 not when he works so hard
rev3-6327740528416575363-00023 i think i'm a lot bigger in personality
rev3-6327740528416575363-00024 do you think in certain sectors it keeps the wages down because migrants are prepared to work for
rev3-6327740528416575363-00025 they do say that migration has kept a downward pressure on wages in
rev3-6327740528416575363-00026 who may think that those jobs aren't the kind of jobs they want to do
rev3-6327740528416575363-00027 but i think that rather than think
rev3-6327740528416575363-00028 the problem is migration and therefore we should stop that
rev3-6327740528416575363-00036 because people come here
rev3-6327740528416575363-00037 they want to work
rev3-6327740528416575363-00038 they will then pay taxes
rev3-6327740528416575363-00039 i used to have people for dinner once a week
rev3-6327941532886024424-00001 the safer society will be
rev3-6327941532886024424-00002 full of contrition
rev3-6327941532886024424-00006 you realise what this means
rev3-6327980187591690710-00003 that will be really helpful
rev3-6328038169780654524-00001 many of them left from here in southampton
rev3-6328038169780654524-00003 the valentines' six cylinder diesel engines roared into life
rev3-6328038169780654524-00004 with the canvas screens providing little
rev3-6328038169780654524-00005 protection from the incoming waves
rev3-6328038169780654524-00008 what it would have been like for someone like frank
rev3-6328038169780654524-00009 eight ounces of gunpowder
rev3-6328038169780654524-00010 brown paper bag
rev3-6328038169780654524-00012 small explosives could be detonated to break off the tail section
rev3-6328038169780654524-00013 technology was the silent ally
rev3-6328038169780654524-00014 it paved the way for men to fight on the beaches of normandy
rev3-6328111613590949805-00003 who is an expert in york
rev3-6328111613590949805-00004 it says it there
rev3-6328111613590949805-00006 someone called wimpy klop
rev3-6328111613590949805-00009 can we get the owners to agree
rev3-6328111613590949805-00010 so after the second world war
rev3-6328111613590949805-00012 and get the money
rev3-6328111613590949805-00013 we call him the old general
rev3-6328111613590949805-00015 he was staying with them
rev3-6328111613590949805-00016 normally what we would do is we would package up this information and we would present it to a
rev3-6328111613590949805-00017 in this litigious environment in the united states
rev3-6328111613590949805-00018 what worries people is being sued
rev3-6328111613590949805-00019 and what difference would it make to you if we could prove it
rev3-6328111613590949805-00021 so quite a long time ago
rev3-6328111613590949805-00023 it's always going to raise questions
rev3-6328111613590949805-00024 it's from bruce kaiser
rev3-6328111613590949805-00025 i would guess the probability of this occurring randomly approaches the same probability of someone
rev3-6328111613590949805-00026 using the same paint in exactly the same way
rev3-6328111613590949805-00027 if we can do that
rev3-6328111613590949805-00029 the sad fact is you may not own this picture
rev3-6328111613590949805-00030 because even if there is confusion about the ownership
rev3-6328312618060398848-00009 thank you for supporting my malvolio
rev3-6328312618060398848-00010 photography is very much part of show business
rev3-6328312618060398848-00011 if the royal shakespeare company give me suitable parts
rev3-6328351272766065122-00002 especially mammal life
rev3-6328351272766065122-00003 but working as a team
rev3-6328351272766065122-00006 why is it so valuable
rev3-6328351272766065122-00007 when the scales became in great demand for asian wildlife trade
rev3-6328393792942295524-00001 spend some time making sure we get it exactly right
rev3-6328393792942295524-00002 it's much better because you don't create landfill and you're reusing what you've got about
rev3-6328393792942295524-00003 it's five to one
rev3-6328393792942295524-00004 which means it's five sand to one cement
rev3-6328393792942295524-00005 so there doesn't need to be a layer of hardcore beneath the cement and brick
rev3-6328393792942295524-00006 and my grandma and my grandad
rev3-6328393792942295524-00010 and birds actually like to be able to hop in and look around in a hedge
rev3-6328512334039666732-00003 is it possible to do that
rev3-6328512334039666732-00005 it's got to be the sugar in combination with other things
rev3-6328512334039666732-00007 when we are exposed to different things
rev3-6328512334039666732-00008 judging from today
rev3-6328512334039666732-00010 as ruth goodman's been learning
rev3-6328512334039666732-00012 stop consuming it
rev3-6328512334039666732-00013 with the entire industry based upon slavery
rev3-6328656644940810739-00006 they can come here and spend some time relaxing
rev3-6328656644940810739-00011 i'd rather be in josh's spot
rev3-6328764878116731644-00002 this is the show where all the questions have been asked to 100 people before the show
rev3-6328764878116731644-00003 and all our celebrities have to do is come up with the answers that none of those 100 people could
rev3-6328764878116731644-00005 each of our celebrities is playing for a nominated charity
rev3-6328764878116731644-00007 we just had a ball
rev3-6328764878116731644-00008 let's just talk about m people
rev3-6328764878116731644-00010 a lot of people
rev3-6328764878116731644-00013 let's change and get back to gardening as well
rev3-6328764878116731644-00014 who was your drummer
rev3-6328764878116731644-00019 six on the second
rev3-6328764878116731644-00021 let's play our five little tracks and here they are
rev3-6328764878116731644-00022 and it's a multisensory centre for people with special needs
rev3-6328764878116731644-00023 which is the twins and multiple births association and they actually helped me and gave me lots of
rev3-6328764878116731644-00025 if it's right and it's pointless
rev3-6328764878116731644-00028 this has to be pointless for you to win that jackpot
rev3-6328764878116731644-00029 as today's show is a celebrity special
rev3-6328764878116731644-00030 join us next time
rev3-6328764878116731644-00031 when we'll be putting more obscure knowledge to the test on pointless
rev3-6328764878116731644-00032 and playing us out with moving on up
rev3-6328962017115556355-00001 so that's a very healthy young plant
rev3-6328962017115556355-00002 instead of being opposite one another
rev3-6328962017115556355-00003 we're used to crab apples being big fruit
rev3-6328962017115556355-00004 which are about three or four years older
rev3-6328962017115556355-00007 some of my favourite fruits
rev3-6328962017115556355-00009 they store the damp
rev3-6328962017115556355-00010 i just keep trying different stuff and the stuff that works and looks right
rev3-6328962017115556355-00011 because that's it
rev3-6329054788409218032-00003 ten favourite dishes that i cook
rev3-6329054788409218032-00004 i don't fancy that
rev3-6329054788409218032-00008 so i hope that he does like it
rev3-6329054788409218032-00016 they did amazingly well
rev3-6329054788409218032-00017 they're eating healthier
rev3-6329062519350282760-00002 because using vegetables in a dessert has become more popular nowadays
rev3-6329062519350282760-00006 but anything can happen with dessert
rev3-6329062519350282760-00008 he's got 15 minutes left to go
rev3-6329062519350282760-00009 his ice cream is not even in the machine
rev3-6329062519350282760-00011 regardless of their background
rev3-6329062519350282760-00013 right hand out to shake
rev3-6329062519350282760-00014 and then step back
rev3-6329062519350282760-00016 through to the judges
rev3-6329062519350282760-00017 i didn't want to be going home on thursday
rev3-6329151425173313518-00001 i know i don't sound it
rev3-6329151425173313518-00002 but i'm a scot by birth
rev3-6329151425173313518-00003 for what it's worth
rev3-6329151425173313518-00004 it was rather male
rev3-6329151425173313518-00005 it felt slightly dark
rev3-6329151425173313518-00006 it was fiercely pro british unionist and it was mildly conservative
rev3-6329151425173313518-00007 in every possible cultural way
rev3-6329151425173313518-00010 where women seem to be running almost everything and which is
rev3-6329151425173313518-00011 so the question is very straightforward and simple to pose
rev3-6329151425173313518-00013 the scottish conservative and unionist party
rev3-6329151425173313518-00015 an achievement that would stand for half a century to come
rev3-6329151425173313518-00016 the tories then could have called themselves the party of scotland
rev3-6329151425173313518-00017 back in the day
rev3-6329151425173313518-00018 there were lots of small businesses
rev3-6329151425173313518-00023 and all these industries
rev3-6329151425173313518-00024 which had a great past
rev3-6329151425173313518-00025 the tories got the blame for that
rev3-6329151425173313518-00026 you also became
rev3-6329151425173313518-00029 and they were immensely proud of the ships they sent down the clyde
rev3-6329151425173313518-00030 many of them royal naval ships
rev3-6329151425173313518-00031 and if you weren't labour
rev3-6329151425173313518-00033 the women in the scheme in old monkland
rev3-6329151425173313518-00034 that i was born and brought up in
rev3-6329151425173313518-00035 they were at the doors because this was a girl from coatbridge going to the uni
rev3-6329151425173313518-00036 the end of heavy industry on the clyde and so forth
rev3-6329151425173313518-00037 people had to move away
rev3-6329151425173313518-00039 what scotland now is
rev3-6329151425173313518-00040 produces a post industrial politics
rev3-6329151425173313518-00041 what does that mean
rev3-6329151425173313518-00042 going to this school
rev3-6329151425173313518-00043 therefore i vote for that party
rev3-6329151425173313518-00044 which gave them power at the heart of the labour party and therefore at westminster
rev3-6329151425173313518-00046 she was an attractive woman
rev3-6329151425173313518-00047 could sustain itself
rev3-6329151425173313518-00049 ladies and gentlemen
rev3-6329151425173313518-00051 i stand before you
rev3-6329151425173313518-00054 and if you wish it
rev3-6329151425173313518-00055 even in the 1979 general election
rev3-6329151425173313518-00056 margaret thatcher's great triumph
rev3-6329151425173313518-00057 labour in scotland had a clear majority
rev3-6329151425173313518-00058 44 out of 71 of the available seats
rev3-6329151425173313518-00061 you something something lunatic
rev3-6329151425173313518-00062 if they push on with the unacceptable proposals of recent years
rev3-6329151425173313518-00064 it looks from the latest figures
rev3-6329151425173313518-00066 then basically what was left tended to be non catholic
rev3-6329151425173313518-00067 who set up the adam smith institute subsequently
rev3-6329151425173313518-00068 even more important
rev3-6329151425173313518-00071 when the big state was at its biggest
rev3-6329151425173313518-00072 just two years before she was forced from power
rev3-6329151425173313518-00074 perhaps it would be best
rev3-6329151425173313518-00075 but first they had to believe in wealth creation
rev3-6329151425173313518-00076 otherwise where did the money come from
rev3-6329151425173313518-00077 and they had to believe in original sin
rev3-6329151425173313518-00078 and that they should look after their own families first and they should not depend on high
rev3-6329151425173313518-00079 scots had had enough of what they regarded as margaret thatcher's grating
rev3-6329151425173313518-00080 that perfectly manicured fingernail jabbing at them
rev3-6329151425173313518-00081 the churchmen made it clear they were distinctly unamused
rev3-6329151425173313518-00082 they spoke for many scots
rev3-6329151425173313518-00085 but they're predictable conservative attacks
rev3-6329151425173313518-00086 the randomness of human life is very
rev3-6329151425173313518-00087 we would not have lived through new labour
rev3-6329151425173313518-00088 more than 22 years on
rev3-6329151425173313518-00090 the tories would have been different
rev3-6329151425173313518-00092 over domestic affairs
rev3-6329151425173313518-00093 in the 1970s had been a dominant issue in the politics of the labour government at that time
rev3-6329151425173313518-00095 part of every one of us
rev3-6329151425173313518-00096 and we respect it
rev3-6329151425173313518-00098 if there are any
rev3-6329151425173313518-00099 but especially in the local areas
rev3-6329151425173313518-00100 that didn't mean it wasn't successful in scotland
rev3-6329151425173313518-00101 while you had much
rev3-6329151425173313518-00102 much disillusionment with the labour party in scotland
rev3-6329151425173313518-00103 and i think that is
rev3-6329151425173313518-00104 a combination of that
rev3-6329151425173313518-00105 because people in scotland wanted a parliament
rev3-6329151425173313518-00107 because people wanted
rev3-6329151425173313518-00108 scotland wanted a scottish parliament and therefore
rev3-6329151425173313518-00111 where people want a greater sense of identity
rev3-6329151425173313518-00112 look for identity
rev3-6329151425173313518-00113 where identity politics is much more important
rev3-6329151425173313518-00114 whether it's uk and brussels
rev3-6329151425173313518-00115 or whether it's
rev3-6329151425173313518-00116 legal and decisive
rev3-6329151425173313518-00117 in the coming days
rev3-6329151425173313518-00118 and i think then we need to move forward and say
rev3-6329151425173313518-00119 if there are problems of uncertainty and lack of clarity
rev3-6329151425173313518-00120 and i don't think we should just let this go on year after year
rev3-6329835613463566698-00001 tell me what would you do
rev3-6329835613463566698-00002 would you buy this
rev3-6329835613463566698-00005 this is quite a bold project and yet you don't seem remotely fazed by any of it
rev3-6329835613463566698-00007 maybe that's incredibly naive of me but i just think it will be ok and it will all work out
rev3-6329835613463566698-00011 imagine the kind of farmer who has leisure time
rev3-6329835613463566698-00014 in the section about the dudleston farms
rev3-6329835613463566698-00015 once we get over these issues
rev3-6329835613463566698-00017 these actually carry the sashes and the weights in here
rev3-6329835613463566698-00018 we can't finish our structural phase of our mortgage
rev3-6329835613463566698-00020 which we don't need
rev3-6329835613463566698-00021 she wants them to read
rev3-6329835613463566698-00022 at the end of the day
rev3-6329835613463566698-00023 we can say it wasn't in budget but it needs to be done
rev3-6329835613463566698-00024 it's got a missing tooth
rev3-6329835613463566698-00025 he also founded the local grammar school
rev3-6329835613463566698-00026 the grant was obtained under which was founded the royal free grammar school of shrewsbury
rev3-6329835613463566698-00027 who is that person
rev3-6329893595522062514-00003 me and my best mate
rev3-6329893595522062514-00004 not for any other reason
rev3-6329893595522062514-00005 i'm not doing it
rev3-6329893595522062514-00006 i'm not flaming going in the transport that he's organised
rev3-6329893595522062514-00007 what is the plural for mecca
rev3-6329893595522062514-00009 at the same level of their profession
rev3-6329893595522062514-00010 three michelin stars
rev3-6329893595522122781-00002 it's all been fairly recent
rev3-6329893595522122781-00005 it's not diabetes
rev3-6329893595522122781-00006 it's not an infection
rev3-6329893595522122781-00007 it's not a stroke
rev3-6329893595522122781-00008 i feel like we're running out of time
rev3-6329893595522122781-00010 normal antibody levels
rev3-6329893595522122781-00011 similar partial paralysis
rev4-6300370419826092098-00001 so we need you to help us in our revival campaign
rev4-6300370419826092098-00002 or into vodka and adding a bit of honey
rev4-6300370419826092098-00003 those should have rooted
rev4-6300370419826092098-00004 maybe in a greenhouse
rev4-6300370419826092098-00006 versatile plant with so many great uses
rev4-6300370419826092098-00007 i think they're an important part of our heritage and one that we should be proud to revive
rev4-6300370419826092098-00010 but the gardens have been swept away by later monarchs demonstrating later
rev4-6300370419826092098-00012 that's the point
rev4-6300370419826092098-00013 so they look radically different but their origins are actually from the same place
rev4-6300370419826092098-00014 what are the key practicalities
rev4-6300370419826092098-00016 they look fantastic
rev4-6300370419826092098-00018 which gives me a very instantly recognisable design
rev4-6300370419826092098-00020 crunchy lettuce but
rev4-6300370419826092098-00024 they're very low maintenance
rev4-6300370419826092098-00025 they offer year round structure and the design
rev4-6301320037095305408-00002 the gist of it is
rev4-6301320037095305408-00003 i'll have it all squared
rev4-6301320037095305408-00004 just when you think you're having the worst day possible
rev4-6301320037095305408-00006 that kit has to be here at 11 o'clock
rev4-6301320037095305408-00007 all those people want to take my picture
rev4-6301320037095305408-00009 if you don't go under again
rev4-6301320037095305408-00010 like i never do
rev4-6302978323968228875-00005 even if it's only a single one
rev4-6302978323968228875-00007 and for the customers
rev4-6302978323968228875-00008 don't bring tom
rev4-6302978323968228875-00010 why did you bring me in here
rev4-6302978323968228875-00011 whether you've got a window box
rev4-6302978323968228875-00012 whether you've got a hanging basket
rev4-6302978323968228875-00013 if you soak the flowers of this they've just come out the greenhouse you'll end up blemishing the
rev4-6302978323968228875-00015 without people like yourselves
rev4-6302978323968228875-00016 the pelargonium industry
rev4-6302978323968228875-00017 you've been sniffing those geranium leaves
rev4-6302978323968228875-00019 not just in the uk
rev4-6302978323968228875-00020 but in the world
rev4-6302978323968228875-00021 between four to six weeks' time and by the end of this season
rev4-6302978323968228875-00022 september or october
rev4-6302978323968228875-00023 very nice looking plant by early autumn and then you're multiplying your favourite
rev4-6303167732026041278-00001 the majestic kirby hall in northamptonshire
rev4-6303167732026041278-00004 also wanted the queen to come and stay at his house
rev4-6303167732026041278-00005 let's talk about them
rev4-6303167732026041278-00006 under the glass domes
rev4-6303167732026041278-00007 possibly even into the early part of the 20th century
rev4-6303167732026041278-00011 but was in need of some serious tlc
rev4-6303167732026041278-00013 i wasn't given it
rev4-6303167732026041278-00014 i was virtually given it
rev4-6303167732026041278-00017 there was no paint in the way that we understand it
rev4-6303167732026041278-00018 and single objects that are found in this way
rev4-6303167732026041278-00019 are very seldom viewed as treasure trove
rev4-6303167732026041278-00023 in its day it was home to sumptuous wealth and sir christopher hatton
rev4-6306811582279909115-00001 and it was once voted the most haunted house in britain
rev4-6306811582279909115-00003 more than 400 years later
rev4-6306811582279909115-00004 on the anniversary of her death
rev4-6306811582279909115-00005 it's said her headless ghost arrives here in a carriage driven by headless horses and a headless
rev4-6306811582279909115-00006 i'll be back here to find out what really goes on behind the closed doors of this beautiful and
rev4-6306811582279909115-00007 you might consider house hunting in norfolk
rev4-6306811582279909115-00009 making homes in this lovely county incredible value for those seeking a rural retreat
rev4-6306811582279909115-00010 which is great news for today's buyers
rev4-6306811582279909115-00011 we have the seaside
rev4-6306811582279909115-00012 you're both retired
rev4-6306811582279909115-00013 there are some converted barns
rev4-6306811582279909115-00014 and the same person that converted those built this house in the same style
rev4-6306811582279909115-00015 because nigel was so stern about the budget
rev4-6306811582279909115-00018 that's my whole life sorted
rev4-6306811582279909115-00019 and it really is all she ever talks about
rev4-6306811582279909115-00021 and then had it built
rev4-6306811582279909115-00022 i think it's a gorgeous place
rev4-6306811582279909115-00023 it was on the market for 450
rev4-6306811582279909115-00025 with the other homes
rev4-6306811582279909115-00026 we've tried to accommodate the family that they're going to be leaving behind
rev4-6306811582279909115-00027 but the mystery house
rev4-6306811582279909115-00030 the question is
rev4-6306811582279909115-00033 it really was the perfect home for them and the family
rev4-6306811582279909115-00034 it had everything they asked for
rev4-6306811582279909115-00035 and even though he needs some time
rev4-6306870852828565379-00002 in the fairy tales
rev4-6306870852828565379-00004 in making people think that they had a common german heritage to look back
rev4-6306870852828565379-00006 according to my guidebook
rev4-6306870852828565379-00007 occupations are chiefly with timber
rev4-6306870852828565379-00008 was heard in these valleys
rev4-6306870852828565379-00010 eastern railways were still advertising trips to germany and 6
rev4-6306870852828565379-00013 thoughts about the beauty of nature
rev4-6306870852828565379-00014 now it's surrounded by the skyscrapers of the modern city of frankfurt
rev4-6306870852828565379-00015 there were three stations before that
rev4-6306870852828565379-00016 i love to stay in a traditional hotel
rev4-6306870852828565379-00017 that's the impression many people have
rev4-6306870852828565379-00018 and the problem is people don't really understand that much about economics
rev4-6306870852828565379-00019 where he was born in 1749
rev4-6306870852828565379-00021 by your language
rev4-6306870852828565379-00022 i think without the burschenschaften
rev4-6306870852828565379-00023 for the first time in the world
rev4-6306870852828565379-00024 you're blowing air between these two points
rev4-6306870852828565379-00026 models of trains
rev4-6306870852828565379-00027 amongst the many german states that had been overrun by the french emperor napoleon and whose
rev4-6306870852828565379-00028 there arose the idea of creating a nation
rev4-6306870852828565379-00029 germany was a great power
rev4-6308177381880006979-00001 the writing garden which
rev4-6308177381880006979-00002 is mainly white
rev4-6308177381880006979-00004 but i do want to share and celebrate the animals that are enjoying it
rev4-6308177381880006979-00005 but the flowers are over now
rev4-6308177381880006979-00006 doesn't look good
rev4-6308177381880006979-00007 not much else is getting a benefit from it
rev4-6308177381880006979-00008 even though you can't see it
rev4-6308177381880006979-00010 but i think it can be done
rev4-6308177381880006979-00011 when you're planting for bees in particular
rev4-6308177381880006979-00012 but insects in general
rev4-6308177381880006979-00013 it's covering what i'm doing now
rev4-6308177381880006979-00017 so that should anything happen in one area where the plants were displayed
rev4-6308177381880006979-00022 but not until you've done these jobs for the weekend
rev4-6308177381880006979-00024 not least from the building and grounds
rev4-6308177381880006979-00026 i don't flood them every now and then and let them dry out
rev4-6308177381880006979-00027 grow them on and you'll be harvesting them in late september and october
rev4-6308177381880006979-00028 as the only female in a hard
rev4-6308312673349834578-00004 wombats are like little bulldozers
rev4-6308312673349834578-00008 this is the kangaroo bible
rev4-6308312673349834578-00010 i give him a teddy bear or a punching bag
rev4-6308312673349834578-00013 it's a good feeling
rev4-6309468449049188125-00004 it's gone from tired and old
rev4-6309468449049188125-00006 and he's old school
rev4-6309468449049188125-00007 and he's going to turn those battered old doors into something saleable
rev4-6309468449049188125-00016 chunky bits of timber
rev4-6309468449049188125-00017 and they are really rough and ready
rev4-6309468449049188125-00018 it's going to be a lot of work
rev4-6309468449049188125-00020 with a new baby on the way
rev4-6309468449049188125-00021 that 99 will definitely come in handy
rev4-6309468449049188125-00024 norman has made something really beautiful with those old scraps
rev4-6309468449049188125-00026 we've handed over a little bit of money along the way
rev4-6309824072341293478-00001 i'm ted and i'm studying to become a barrister
rev4-6309824072341293478-00002 very much we practised for it
rev4-6309824072341293478-00004 i don't know anything about ella eyre but on the basis that ellie goulding definitely had an album
rev4-6309824072341293478-00005 i guess i'll go for her
rev4-6309824072341293478-00007 i think it's a white cross on a blue background
rev4-6309824072341293478-00008 this is what we have been playing towards
rev4-6309824072341293478-00009 it is time for the final round
rev4-6309824072341293478-00010 i have read about him
rev4-6310166810731517953-00002 they talk a lot about the feel of natural energy in an arena
rev4-6310166810731517953-00005 as far as vienna at one time
rev4-6310166810731517953-00007 probably been at the heart of human affairs
rev4-6310166810731517953-00009 for new generation and new age
rev4-6310166810731517953-00011 i don't remember
rev4-6310166810731517953-00014 all of these troglodyte caves everywhere and the nice landscape
rev4-6310166810731517953-00015 many years later
rev4-6310166810731517953-00016 because it was empty
rev4-6310166810731517953-00017 when i was a little child
rev4-6310166810731517953-00025 so it's against islamic law
rev4-6310166810731517953-00026 i'm really not a good muslim person
rev4-6310195157515669986-00001 the show where a team of five quiz challengers pit their wits against possibly the greatest quiz
rev4-6310195157515669986-00002 i'm kim and i'm an ncs recruitment officer
rev4-6310195157515669986-00004 that was brilliant
rev4-6310195157515669986-00005 i'm katherine and i'm a mentoring coordinator
rev4-6310195157515669986-00006 so it's a round
rev4-6310195157515669986-00008 nothing at all is coming
rev4-6310195157515669986-00009 wouldn't it be nice to get on with me neighbours
rev4-6310195157515669986-00010 i can't even think of a sensible answer
rev4-6310195157515669986-00011 i do know it when i heard the answer
rev4-6310195157515669986-00012 i know the song
rev4-6310195157515669986-00014 but i thought 40
rev4-6310195157515669986-00015 it's time for the final round
rev4-6310195157515669986-00016 so on that basis
rev4-6310195157515669986-00017 so we're going to go with royal standard
rev4-6310968251628953184-00001 and they might not even make it through the first battle
rev4-6310968251628953184-00002 ladies and gentlemen
rev4-6310968251628953184-00010 it may not look anything like it does now
rev4-6310968251628953184-00011 or did to start the fight
rev4-6310968251628953184-00014 and had a look at what was remaining
rev4-6310968251628953184-00018 for the last time tonight
rev4-6311014637275749987-00001 sports is once again hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons
rev4-6311014637275749987-00002 you get them in the post
rev4-6311014637275749987-00003 with that much at stake
rev4-6311014637275749987-00007 and then the shame
rev4-6311014637275749987-00012 ask him what he's taking
rev4-6311014637275749987-00013 how he's taking them
rev4-6311014637275749987-00014 who's he get them off
rev4-6311014637275749987-00018 and then when i met natalie
rev4-6311014637275749987-00025 and there are people who will say
rev4-6311014637275749987-00026 he only got into that much trouble because he took too much
rev4-6311014637275749987-00027 but that definitely isn't true
rev4-6311014637275749987-00028 these are dangerous drugs
rev4-6311014637275749987-00029 they just want to look better
rev4-6311014637275749987-00030 male pattern baldness
rev4-6311014637275749987-00031 impaired erectile function
rev4-6311014637275749987-00032 and in about 10 of the cases
rev4-6311014637275749987-00033 the cells die prematurely
rev4-6311014637275749987-00034 the longer that you have been taking your steroids
rev4-6311014637275749987-00035 it would be very worrying
rev4-6311014637275749987-00036 because this would mean that men who take steroids over long periods of time might be at greater
rev4-6311014637275749987-00037 and that the vast majority of cigarette smokers were still under the age of 50 now
rev4-6311014637275749987-00038 in that scenario
rev4-6311014637275749987-00039 the occasional report of emphysema
rev4-6311014637275749987-00040 the heart in fact is the strongest muscle in the body
rev4-6311014637275749987-00041 and it's the only muscle that never rests
rev4-6311014637275749987-00043 they have not gone through clinical trials
rev4-6311014637275749987-00044 and yet their use does not exist in the shadows
rev4-6311014637275749987-00046 but these new molecules have never been approved for human use
rev4-6311014637275749987-00047 it's not a big statistical trial
rev4-6311014637275749987-00048 i think because i
rev4-6311014637275749987-00049 like everyone else
rev4-6311014637275749987-00050 would like to look a bit better and would like a magic injection to do it
rev4-6311014637275749987-00051 but this is not the way
rev4-6311014637275749987-00052 these are dangerous drugs
rev4-6311014637275749987-00053 you're on all these dosages
rev4-6311014637275749987-00054 how do you feel
rev4-6311014637275749987-00055 that i've got a tummy
rev4-6311014637275749987-00056 which means that they have to tell us where they're available to be tested every single day of the
rev4-6311014637275749987-00057 and i was immediately
rev4-6311014637275749987-00058 the day that paper came out
rev4-6311014637275749987-00060 i had no idea that was coming
rev4-6311014637275749987-00063 and at that point
rev4-6311014637275749987-00064 if you're anything like me
rev4-6311014637275749987-00066 i've roped in my identical twin brother
rev4-6311014637275749987-00068 so what were going to be doing is passing a very mild electrical current over an area of the brain
rev4-6311014637275749987-00069 maybe a slight burning
rev4-6311280066254641716-00006 is covered with paintings
rev4-6311280066254641716-00010 trying to find direction
rev4-6311280066254641716-00013 how much has romania changed
rev4-6311651151429016127-00001 there was one house on this grand and elegant street where you never wanted to end up
rev4-6311651151429016127-00003 but you also have to remember the location of hungary
rev4-6311651151429016127-00004 where we are located
rev4-6311651151429016127-00014 much more independent
rev4-6311651151429016127-00015 this is the levadia palace
rev4-6311651151429016127-00018 and many of them have positive
rev4-6311651151429016127-00019 nice memories of the soviet days
rev4-6312022236603390541-00004 and they think that tradition's not necessary
rev4-6312022236603390541-00008 because this is
rev4-6312022236603390541-00009 so it was very exciting
rev4-6312022236603390541-00010 that's for our president
rev4-6312022236603390541-00012 as well as russian academy of science
rev4-6312066045269810824-00004 met irving while he was in new york city
rev4-6312066045269810824-00006 they raised their glasses and the toast was
rev4-6312066045269810824-00007 down with the train
rev4-6312066045269810824-00008 and a whole budget of others
rev4-6312066045269810824-00010 as any cadet at the academy could tell you
rev4-6312066045269810824-00012 is one of the most attractive places on the river and the seat of the national military academy
rev4-6312066045269810824-00015 without a doubt
rev4-6312066045269810824-00016 it came close to almost destroying this nation
rev4-6312066045269810824-00017 31 years on active duty as a colonel
rev4-6312066045269810824-00021 having come to know a little bit about this mighty river
rev4-6312066045269810824-00022 i personally would always choose a railway line
rev4-6312066045269810824-00023 going back to that to try to form a stronger american identity when so many things are being
rev4-6312066045269810824-00026 new york made a statement
rev4-6312066045269810824-00027 it will be the largest and most splendid edifice in america
rev4-6312066045269810824-00028 we're a lot different than other states in terms of our philosophy
rev4-6313565847849574520-00003 50 of the robots gone at the very
rev4-6313565847849574520-00006 and we will follow them
rev4-6313565847849574520-00013 for the last time tonight
rev4-6313656042293295351-00001 my father went to west africa
rev4-6313656042293295351-00003 i'd never seen a black man
rev4-6313656042293295351-00004 to the best of my recollection
rev4-6313656042293295351-00007 and the medical officer might have been your father
rev4-6313656042293295351-00008 it might have been on its own in europe
rev4-6313656042293295351-00009 but it had a vast empire
rev4-6313656042293295351-00012 in the deepest jungle
rev4-6313656042293295351-00014 they've been likened to the battle of stalingrad and the battle of el alamein and midway as
rev4-6313656042293295351-00016 saw that it no longer had the strategic value it had
rev4-6313656042293295351-00018 those fatal shots
rev4-6313877662475262663-00001 things didn't really get much better
rev4-6313877662475262663-00005 they know of python
rev4-6313877662475262663-00012 we're building a house now in the forest
rev4-6313877662475262663-00013 which is coming on very nicely
rev4-6313877662475262663-00015 and we have a lovely daughter whose name actually by the way is chelsea
rev4-6313877662475262663-00016 that's the best that i could ever wish them
rev4-6313877662475262663-00017 i think i can see where you're coming from asking that question
rev4-6313877662475262663-00018 as a brave nation that however has something to offer here and now
rev4-6313877662475262663-00028 what about your love life here
rev4-6313877662475262663-00030 this is a scheduled service
rev4-6313877662475262663-00033 i've great respect for these guys
rev4-6313877662475262663-00034 but it was a great run
rev4-6313877662475262663-00039 and it's really hard physical work
rev4-6313936933024013236-00002 exercise is a waste of time
rev4-6313936933024013236-00004 congratulations about the baby
rev4-6313936933024013236-00006 i was all right in the end
rev4-6313936933024013236-00008 it was a one off
rev4-6313936933024013236-00009 it was a one off
rev4-6313936933024013236-00011 but you have to understand
rev4-6313936933024013236-00014 and phil wouldn't tell me anything
rev4-6314248747649637090-00002 000 foot mountain range in the heart of europe
rev4-6314248747649637090-00003 but these are the high tatras
rev4-6314248747649637090-00004 part of the carpathian range
rev4-6314248747649637090-00009 i think czechs are very social
rev4-6314248747649637090-00013 i guess it was a larger community
rev4-6314248747649637090-00014 not everything was wrong
rev4-6314248747649637090-00015 some people still have the wall in their heads
rev4-6314248747649637090-00017 what people plan
rev4-6314248747649637090-00018 so what was shocking for him was the result
rev4-6314308018198387664-00001 and i may be no action woman
rev4-6314308018198387664-00002 you may find him
rev4-6314308018198387664-00005 are you eating properly
rev4-6314308018198387664-00006 and if he improves
rev4-6314308018198387664-00007 i want to isolate a patient from exposure to the wi fi
rev4-6314308018198387664-00008 if your symptoms fade while you're in here
rev4-6314308018198387664-00009 we're looking back at how sport and music came together in the 80s to create some amazing and some
rev4-6314619832824012968-00002 the portuguese who followed him found indigenous people here
rev4-6314619832824012968-00004 cotton and tobacco that they set up
rev4-6314619832824012968-00007 but it's low tide
rev4-6314619832824012968-00010 this is very powerful
rev4-6314619832824012968-00011 so i might find out something very unpleasant
rev4-6314619832824012968-00012 because i'm going to something
rev4-6314619832824012968-00015 you have to run
rev4-6314990917998387385-00003 there's no road access at all
rev4-6314990917998387385-00004 i'm heading south now
rev4-6314990917998387385-00006 in brazil as well
rev4-6314990917998387385-00007 still we're very
rev4-6315050188547072188-00003 before the railways
rev4-6315050188547072188-00011 the railway lines could then ship it back to the ports
rev4-6315050188547072188-00014 it's a really good
rev4-6315405811839181004-00002 lots of outlying farms and a small collection of buildings
rev4-6315405811839181004-00003 thousands of tonnes of ammunition
rev4-6315405811839181004-00004 so his troops were very hungry
rev4-6315405811839181004-00005 so they ate what they could and
rev4-6315405811839181004-00006 whatever they couldn't carry off
rev4-6315405811839181004-00007 the confederate commander
rev4-6315405811839181004-00008 a lot of people consider that one of his greatest victories because he drove the union army from
rev4-6315405811839181004-00009 but i think it's important that when we look back on that and take a certain pride in that that we
rev4-6315405811839181004-00010 it was founded in 1727 and contains about 6
rev4-6315405811839181004-00011 an ideal place for me to begin to discover the spirit of the
rev4-6315405811839181004-00012 when i'm going to sit down in the evening with a nice glass of bourbon
rev4-6315405811839181004-00018 wondering if they're doing it correctly
rev4-6315405811839181004-00019 we didn't see any of that with you
rev4-6315405811839181004-00021 after two months of active debating
rev4-6315405811839181004-00022 88 voted to secede
rev4-6315405811839181004-00023 i feel much that makes me feel at home
rev4-6315405811839181004-00026 what was that saying
rev4-6315405811839181004-00027 that was saying that
rev4-6315405811839181004-00029 tell me about that
rev4-6315405811839181004-00031 it wasn't even close to the uss monitor
rev4-6315405811839181004-00033 only one turret
rev4-6315405811839181004-00034 virtually every major combat vessel that was designed
rev4-6315405811839181004-00035 not only the american navy
rev4-6315405811839181004-00036 but in navy's around the world after the battle of hampton roads
rev4-6315405811839181004-00037 they were new vessels
rev4-6315405811839181004-00041 during the revolution
rev4-6315405811839181004-00042 we see ourselves as something else
rev4-6315405811839181004-00043 later in their history
rev4-6315405811839181004-00044 they didn't much like being told by yankees that they shouldn't own slaves
rev4-6315405811839181004-00045 to use the term
rev4-6315405811839181004-00046 you know that doesn't go very well
rev4-6315405811839181004-00047 when john smith returns to england 1609
rev4-6315405811839181004-00049 and that never works out well
rev4-6315405811839181004-00050 that there are great chunks of virginian history that i did not know
rev4-6315405811839181004-00051 it's kind of overshadowed by massachusetts
rev4-6315405811839181004-00052 after the south lost the war in our civil war
rev4-6315405811839181004-00053 where the indians and the pilgrims sat down together
rev4-6315421273721446605-00002 to get through to the next stage
rev4-6315421273721446605-00003 do go to our website
rev4-6315421273721446605-00006 thanks for watching
rev4-6316024287129869379-00001 more and more people would love to have their own property portfolio
rev4-6316024287129869379-00002 then at least you'd have your foot on the property developing ladder
rev4-6316024287129869379-00003 i've never seen a house like this
rev4-6316024287129869379-00007 it sort of works
rev4-6316024287129869379-00010 made in a local factory
rev4-6316024287129869379-00011 the minton factory
rev4-6316024287129869379-00012 but you've got to be very
rev4-6316024287129869379-00013 we looked at a load of houses in the university area
rev4-6316024287129869379-00014 i work part time
rev4-6316024287129869379-00016 they seem to be as sad as i will be to see this floor in the back go
rev4-6316024287129869379-00017 but they mean noise and traffic
rev4-6316024287129869379-00018 the road itself is attractive
rev4-6316024287129869379-00023 that is what lets this flat down
rev4-6316024287129869379-00024 i'd expect to get 1
rev4-6316024287129869379-00027 long gap with trying to sort out the paperwork
rev4-6316024287129869379-00028 i don't think john will have the same problem here
rev4-6316024287129869379-00029 where will john decide he wants the wet room
rev4-6316024287129869379-00030 will their friendship survive this tooting transformation
rev4-6316024287129869379-00032 i wasn't having it
rev4-6316024287129869379-00035 about quarter of a mile from the metro station
rev4-6316024287129869379-00038 so added to all the other things you're going to do to this property
rev4-6316024287129869379-00040 the overall size of it
rev4-6316024287129869379-00042 i'm sure it generated a lot of interest when it went under the hammer
rev4-6316024287129869379-00045 if this is a business
rev4-6316024287129869379-00047 time has passed
rev4-6316024287129869379-00048 paul and andy have got themselves a great property here
rev4-6316024287129869379-00049 and they're making the slight error of not costing in their own time and effort which
rev4-6316163444070195447-00001 they're both still working right now
rev4-6316163444070195447-00007 he's driving well
rev4-6316163444070195447-00008 it's normally something simple
rev4-6318761040290818803-00009 so we're really happy that we got to do that
rev4-6318761040290818803-00012 the flipper was only firing at half power in the last fight
rev4-6318761040290818803-00013 as well as being cold
rev4-6318761040290818803-00019 not just robots
rev4-6318761040290818803-00021 we couldn't have imagined ten
rev4-6318761040290818803-00022 and the price of sensors
rev4-6318761040290818803-00023 and even the house robots aren't safe
rev4-6318761040290818803-00024 for the final time tonight
rev4-6318761040290818803-00026 that's what we do
rev4-6321358636511442057-00002 used it very intelligently
rev4-6321358636511442057-00003 by running away
rev4-6321358636511442057-00004 getting it up to speed and making the attack at the right precise moment
rev4-6321358636511442057-00005 you might have a really nice well engineered machine
rev4-6321358636511442057-00006 ready for the next battle
rev4-6321358636511442057-00008 it was not a knockout
rev4-6321358636511442057-00010 the gas system was misbehaving
rev4-6321358636511442057-00015 even though it lasted the whole three minutes
rev4-6321358636511442057-00017 but who will win
rev4-6322100806860254619-00006 i give you guy self
rev4-6322100806860254619-00008 even when it wasn't his fault
rev4-6322100806860254619-00009 family of my own
rev4-6323198600501050831-00003 it's freezing cold
rev4-6323198600501050831-00006 just loved the lifestyle
rev4-6323198600501050831-00007 working these antisocial hours
rev4-6323198600501050831-00008 there is some health risk
rev4-6323198600501050831-00013 the final test for our final four
rev4-6323198600501050831-00016 and make no mistake
rev4-6323198600501050831-00017 as long as you have got the right training to do the job
rev4-6323198600501050831-00018 you've got the right tools to do the job
rev4-6323198600501050831-00019 you know exactly what's being monitored and why and you know how you can influence that
rev4-6323198600501050831-00020 they might suffer from low self esteem
rev4-6323198600501050831-00022 it's interesting that
rev4-6323198600501050831-00023 when you make monitoring more intense
rev4-6323198600501050831-00024 i don't think we are
rev4-6323198600501050831-00025 and if we want a prosperous
rev4-6323198600501050831-00027 and often in sort of a capacity of care
rev4-6323198600501050831-00029 new jobs do arise
rev4-6323198600501050831-00030 new jobs are created
rev4-6323198600501050831-00032 i think i could live on the minimum wage
rev4-6323198600501050831-00033 that was two reasons
rev4-6323198600501050831-00037 all i've known is farming
rev4-6323221793324446979-00001 look at other gardens
rev4-6323221793324446979-00002 planted in winter
rev4-6323221793324446979-00004 and after last summer's disaster with my grapes
rev4-6323221793324446979-00005 what with wasps and blackbirds
rev4-6323221793324446979-00007 you can simply cut the whole lot flush with the ground round about christmas time and let it start
rev4-6323221793324446979-00008 because there is an element of skill involved
rev4-6323221793324446979-00011 produce their fruit on this year's canes
rev4-6323221793324446979-00012 so it is a job to do
rev4-6323221793324446979-00013 because you don't want more than four or five canes per plant
rev4-6323221793324446979-00015 and so probably my grandfather
rev4-6323221793324446979-00016 who was brought up there
rev4-6323221793324446979-00017 from the same canes
rev4-6323221793324446979-00018 a few years ago
rev4-6323221793324446979-00022 because we think jekyll did it all remotely
rev4-6323221793324446979-00025 and then as autumn comes and it goes
rev4-6323221793324446979-00026 the broccoli can take over the whole space
rev4-6323221793324446979-00028 and by the end of the season it's right up here
rev4-6323221793324446979-00029 and on top of that
rev4-6323221793324446979-00032 i grow vegetables because i like the taste
rev4-6323221793324446979-00035 comparing the two different locations with same varieties
rev4-6323221793324446979-00039 this is hundreds and thousands
rev4-6323221793324446979-00041 so please put any pictures you can on our facebook page
rev4-6323221793324446979-00042 but you've got a bank holiday weekend coming up
rev4-6323221793324446979-00043 so extra time to do extra jobs in the garden
rev4-6323221793324446979-00044 great wasps' nest
rev4-6323221793324446979-00045 which means you stay away
rev4-6323221793324446979-00048 and good flavour this year
rev4-6323817075791736335-00002 will they sink or swim
rev4-6323817075791736335-00010 depending on the age
rev4-6323817075791736335-00013 it's all over the walls
rev4-6323817075791736335-00015 will it have too much of a stigma attached to it
rev4-6323817075791736335-00020 talk me through the two options
rev4-6323817075791736335-00024 i've got the monies in place
rev4-6323817075791736335-00026 he's got the money to complete on the purchase
rev4-6323817075791736335-00028 will he get the planning permission
rev4-6323817075791736335-00029 will he get it sorted out
rev4-6323817075791736335-00030 you can find out later in the show
rev4-6323817075791736335-00032 although in this case
rev4-6323817075791736335-00033 if you're intent on recouping the cash and pocketing the profit
rev4-6323817075791736335-00034 you may very well end up disappointed
rev4-6323817075791736335-00038 this house is probably worth around 120
rev4-6323817075791736335-00041 on paper and in theory
rev4-6323817075791736335-00042 the problem that you're likely to face is actually selling the thing
rev4-6323817075791736335-00046 then you can tell me to shut up
rev4-6323817075791736335-00049 that's fair enough
rev4-6323817075791736335-00050 you have got a great work ethic and
rev4-6323817075791736335-00051 any profit is a profit
rev4-6323817075791736335-00053 some profit is much
rev4-6323817075791736335-00054 much better than none
rev4-6323817075791736335-00055 i'm also pleased he'll consider renting
rev4-6323817075791736335-00056 i just hope whoever bought it was prepared to keep hold
rev4-6323817075791736335-00057 000 on this property
rev4-6323817075791736335-00063 so it would be more sought after
rev4-6323817075791736335-00064 i was expecting around the 70
rev4-6323817075791736335-00065 i have spent a lot of money on these flats
rev4-6323817075791736335-00066 get me money back in the pot
rev4-6323817075791736335-00067 and it gets better
rev4-6323817075791736335-00072 especially the ground floor
rev4-6323817075791736335-00073 whether they be sold or let
rev4-6323817075791736335-00074 it has been done to a high standard
rev4-6323817075791736335-00075 especially for first time buyers
rev4-6323817075791736335-00085 but there's still planning issues to resolve and will he be able to sell the properties
rev4-6323817075791736335-00101 i would suggest that he rents each property out at between 500 and
rev4-6323817075791736335-00106 in order to achieve that
rev4-6323956232732063947-00005 it's a tough fight
rev4-6323956232732063947-00011 all of the robots out there full of energy
rev4-6323956232732063947-00013 we could have flipped them at one point
rev4-6323956232732063947-00017 we can still do it
rev4-6323956232732063947-00019 it healed its scars
rev4-6323956232732063947-00020 this is the final i would have asked for
rev4-6323956232732063947-00022 the teams are ready
rev4-6323956232732063947-00023 for the last time this series
rev4-6323956232732126743-00002 the people of tewkesbury
rev4-6323956232732126743-00003 that came to 483
rev4-6323956232732126743-00004 within two years
rev4-6323956232732126743-00005 and has been turned into a bangle
rev4-6323956232732126743-00006 which in many ways is very wearable
rev4-6323956232732126743-00007 which is not particularly bad news
rev4-6323956232732126743-00008 which is beautiful
rev4-6323956232732126743-00009 that is the designer
rev4-6323956232732126743-00010 but then here on this side
rev4-6323956232732126743-00012 it's after galle's death
rev4-6323956232732126743-00013 but it's still a stunning thing
rev4-6323956232732126743-00014 they are holding that
rev4-6323956232732126743-00016 and i saw this in an auction in australia
rev4-6323956232732126743-00017 they've been in england
rev4-6323956232732126743-00018 there was the father of ornithology
rev4-6323956232732126743-00019 so it was a process partly of print
rev4-6323956232732126743-00020 and if we turn this one round
rev4-6323956232732126743-00024 which was designed in 1900
rev4-6323956232732126743-00025 they were there for espionage
rev4-6323956232732126743-00027 my parents had it before i was born
rev4-6323956232732126743-00028 i was brought up with it
rev4-6323956232732126743-00029 and it is just so remarkably stylish
rev4-6323956232732126743-00030 just look at it
rev4-6323956232732126743-00032 like never before
rev4-6323956232732126743-00034 it's been great
rev4-6324230681142278360-00002 who lurches from one state hand out to the next
rev4-6324230681142278360-00006 there's no doubt about it
rev4-6324230681142278360-00007 this is all very promising
rev4-6324230681142278360-00009 i can't say i do
rev4-6324230681142278360-00010 apart from anything else
rev4-6324230681142278360-00013 i was just thinking what an eventful day it's been
rev4-6324230681142278360-00016 we could be very happy together
rev4-6324698403080812792-00002 how waterproof they are
rev4-6324698403080812792-00005 they share a lot of the same design and technology as high performance running shoes
rev4-6324698403080812792-00010 i'm doing ok here
rev4-6324698403080812792-00011 and you send that to the factory
rev4-6324698403080812792-00013 was broken in the 1850s when the industrial revolution came to
rev4-6324698403080812792-00014 so shoes today could end up in a high street in workington down the road
rev4-6324698403080812792-00015 or fifth avenue
rev4-6324698403080812792-00016 i loved that they were really pretty and delicate
rev4-6324698403080812792-00017 how do they make them
rev4-6324698403080812792-00021 what does it like
rev4-6324698403080812792-00022 in the afternoon
rev4-6324698403080812792-00023 you might get one size
rev4-6324698403080812792-00024 you'll buy a perfect shoe that fits
rev4-6324698403080812792-00027 somewhere in the world
rev4-6324698403080875597-00006 helping all those people
rev4-6324698403080875597-00007 don't worry about it
rev4-6324713864963081921-00001 it dwarfs anything we have in britain
rev4-6324713864963081921-00006 the reason travelling seems so seamless is because of all the efforts that go on behind the scenes
rev4-6324713864963081921-00008 in 70 million square feet of office space
rev4-6324713864963081921-00011 they've just completed the main stage of construction
rev4-6324713864963081921-00013 some items are held for three months
rev4-6324713864963081921-00014 we're running about 1
rev4-6324713864963081921-00015 200 people all day
rev4-6324713864963081921-00016 and then at our season
rev4-6324713864963081921-00017 which is between thanksgiving and christmas
rev4-6324713864963081921-00019 when things are good
rev4-6324713864963081921-00021 at the end of the day
rev4-6324713864963081921-00024 it depends on the drivers
rev4-6324713864963081921-00026 mighty oaks will grow
rev4-6324764116080445123-00001 he still had a chance of not surviving this injury
rev4-6324764116080445123-00004 even if we restart the heart
rev4-6324764116080445123-00005 but from the ecg changes and looking at david
rev4-6324764116080445123-00006 he's got chest pain
rev4-6324764116080445123-00007 it is the giving of an anaesthetic drug and a paralytic
rev4-6324764116080445123-00008 because his heart is still struggling to work
rev4-6324764116080445123-00010 every bump is caused by something else
rev4-6324764116080445123-00011 and you need to piece together all those bits
rev4-6324764116080445123-00012 at the base of the brain
rev4-6324764116080445123-00013 pushing the spinal cord across
rev4-6324764116080445123-00014 then it will be damaging the cord
rev4-6324764116080445123-00017 from that point
rev4-6324764116080445123-00018 if you press enough on that
rev4-6324764116080445123-00019 if you act quickly enough
rev4-6324764116080445123-00020 pulled him out and done exactly the same thing
rev4-6325119739372550419-00005 they share a lot of the same design and technology as high performance running shoes
rev4-6325119739372550419-00014 was broken in the 1850s when the industrial revolution came to
rev4-6325119739372550419-00015 or fifth avenue
rev4-6325119739372550419-00016 i loved that they were really pretty and delicate
rev4-6325119739372550419-00017 how do they make them
rev4-6325119739372550419-00021 what does it like
rev4-6325119739372550419-00022 in the afternoon
rev4-6325119739372550419-00023 you might get one size
rev4-6325119739372550419-00024 you'll buy a perfect shoe that fits
rev4-6325119739372550419-00026 my shoes are behind there
rev4-6325119739372550419-00027 somewhere in the world
rev4-6325440573560032726-00001 on there as well
rev4-6325440573560032726-00002 that is incredible
rev4-6325440573560032726-00003 i think it was even more of a momentous event
rev4-6325440573560032726-00005 people with no money at all
rev4-6325440573560032726-00006 or next to no money
rev4-6325440573560032726-00007 when you came into contact with the state
rev4-6325440573560032726-00008 the post office apart
rev4-6325440573560032726-00009 right up to the 20th century
rev4-6325440573560032726-00011 or tell you what to do
rev4-6325440573560032726-00012 or take some of your money or all these kinds of things
rev4-6325440573560032726-00015 so all these dozens
rev4-6325440573560032726-00016 this is what will benefit
rev4-6325440573560032726-00018 so we work in tandem with each other because they come in obviously to post their parcels
rev4-6325440573560032726-00021 but you remember the old days in the post office
rev4-6325440573560032726-00022 this used to be called the post office's best kept secret
rev4-6325440573560032726-00025 so they can come down
rev4-6325440573560032726-00026 cos i had the heaviest delivery in europe
rev4-6325440573560032726-00027 so each one 40 pounds
rev4-6325440573560032726-00028 the post office
rev4-6325440573560032726-00029 it's a wonderful
rev4-6325440573560032726-00030 but it's backward looking
rev4-6325440573560032726-00031 i want to meet all of the director generals and i want to hear about what they do
rev4-6325440573560032726-00032 so he was restless
rev4-6325440573560032726-00034 do you want to come with me
rev4-6325440573560032726-00035 and we went to trafalgar square and
rev4-6325440573560032726-00036 if he hadn't been postmaster general
rev4-6325440573560032726-00038 wilson had talked in 63 about the white heat of technology and dad was
rev4-6325456035311830751-00002 mexico doesn't generate all that much good press overseas
rev4-6325456035311830751-00005 but i suppose some of my children will become prime minister instead
rev4-6325456035311830751-00006 by all reckoning
rev4-6325456035311830751-00007 it's not even a joke
rev4-6325456035311830751-00013 it's not the door
rev4-6325456035311830751-00017 any slaughterhouse is a lot worse i guess than what we're seeing here
rev4-6325796196721673967-00005 because they add that nice bit of structure
rev4-6325796196721673967-00007 hopefully over time
rev4-6325796196721673967-00009 this is perfect for taking advantage of vertical space like a boundary
rev4-6325796196721673967-00010 these are beautiful
rev4-6325796196721673967-00011 using meadow turf
rev4-6325819389545137915-00001 when i was a child
rev4-6325819389545137915-00002 the only thing that would get me to sleep was my parents reading me the takeaway menu from our
rev4-6325819389545137915-00003 something like that
rev4-6325819389545137915-00004 i don't think she's
rev4-6325819389545137915-00005 at the age of seven
rev4-6325819389545137915-00008 i want you to come to my bedroom
rev4-6325819389545137915-00010 my name is carlos
rev4-6325819389545137915-00011 and the bull's eyes
rev4-6325819389545137915-00012 they say you to be at least a minimum standard
rev4-6325819389545137915-00013 and to prove it
rev4-6325894121976022773-00003 i generally feel safe
rev4-6325894121976022773-00004 you need a bike that's convenient
rev4-6325894121976022773-00005 suddenly appears when you want it
rev4-6325894121976022773-00006 disappears when you don't want it
rev4-6325894121976022773-00008 but that's nothing compared to the price of some of the racing bikes
rev4-6325894121976022773-00009 they can cost up to 10
rev4-6325894121976022773-00010 but you don't have to spend a lot of money to pedal faster
rev4-6325894121976022773-00011 other tyres on other bikes
rev4-6325894121976022773-00013 when you order a bike from this factory
rev4-6325894121976022773-00014 you get a standard saddle but if you really want luxury for your bottom
rev4-6325894121976022773-00016 to make sure it's all right
rev4-6326360555424366722-00003 autumn coming in
rev4-6326360555424366722-00004 where it'll be fine as long as it's in water
rev4-6326360555424366722-00006 and i have got the effect i want
rev4-6326360555424366722-00007 and over the next four weeks
rev4-6326360555424366722-00008 dna testing allows us to identify exactly which group a plant belongs to
rev4-6326360555424366722-00009 but very few are
rev4-6326360555424366722-00012 with an odd sprinkling of annuals
rev4-6326360555424366722-00013 and one of the things that i like to do first
rev4-6326360555424366722-00014 and that keeps them dry
rev4-6326360555424366722-00016 not least cos the ground is often very hard
rev4-6326360555424366722-00017 because you can create the right conditions for it in the pot
rev4-6326360555424366722-00018 it also means if you don't have a garden
rev4-6326360555424366722-00019 you can have a fabulous spring display
rev4-6326360555424366722-00020 like goat droppings
rev4-6326360555424366722-00021 these have been in here for a couple of hours
rev4-6326360555424366722-00022 overnight is perfect
rev4-6326360555424366722-00024 and that's because
rev4-6326360555424366722-00025 like many neighbourhoods around the country
rev4-6326360555424366722-00026 it's had its difficulties
rev4-6326360555424366722-00028 the chance of me experiencing jungle is not very high
rev4-6326360555424366722-00029 i'm able to create
rev4-6326360555424366722-00030 tropical and unusual
rev4-6326360555424366722-00034 i thought that was something i really had to go and see
rev4-6326360555424366722-00037 i always made a beeline for decimus burton's palm house
rev4-6326360555424366722-00038 much better effect
rev4-6326360555424366722-00039 seven or nine stems
rev4-6326360555424366722-00040 no more than that
rev4-6326360555424366722-00041 and that will give you better flower spikes
rev4-6326360555424366722-00042 this main spike will lean over and split the crown at the bottom
rev4-6326360555424366722-00043 it could have as much as 30 or 40 little stems
rev4-6326360555424366722-00044 they're potential flowers
rev4-6326360555424366722-00045 because they're lovely plants
rev4-6326360555424366722-00047 they will always give you pleasure
rev4-6326360555424366722-00048 and they're tough
rev4-6326360555424366722-00050 it's wet and it's cold in winter
rev4-6326360555424366722-00051 they will last the winter they are hardy
rev4-6326360555424366722-00052 after all and then they've got a head start and will grow away next spring
rev4-6326360555424366722-00054 he has won many gold medals from chelsea and is a very
rev4-6326414672012357313-00001 view your property
rev4-6326414672012357313-00002 did today's buyers do their homework
rev4-6326414672012357313-00004 so much work needs to be done
rev4-6326414672012357313-00005 it certainly needs a lot of renovation
rev4-6326414672012357313-00006 everything needs doing
rev4-6326414672012357313-00011 you want to go to a certain level
rev4-6326414672012357313-00013 and it will still suit the needs and the requirements of that family
rev4-6326414672012357313-00014 so in that sense
rev4-6326414672012357313-00015 because you have to take this house back to the bare brick
rev4-6326414672012357313-00016 that's a relatively small budget
rev4-6326414672012357313-00017 the builders we use here in margate were originally a family we housed in london who came from very
rev4-6326414672012357313-00018 who ends up getting the house and how well it's done
rev4-6326414672012357313-00019 michael has a team of builders all ready to go
rev4-6326414672012357313-00021 but if you're not scared off by the state of the place and you pay near the guide price
rev4-6326414672012357313-00022 he's got a tenant already lined up waiting to move in
rev4-6326414672012357313-00023 will things run to plan
rev4-6326414672012357313-00024 will they stick to their budget
rev4-6326414672012357313-00025 there could be some room for some profit here
rev4-6326414672012357313-00028 anybody else can join in
rev4-6326414672012357313-00030 third and final time
rev4-6326414672012357313-00031 that's just one of the things in the grounds
rev4-6326414672012357313-00035 right by the side
rev4-6326414672012357313-00037 what can you do about it
rev4-6326414672012357313-00040 this area of cornwall
rev4-6326414672012357313-00041 famous for its mining in the past
rev4-6326414672012357313-00042 it's got three reception rooms
rev4-6326414672012357313-00043 six seven bedrooms upstairs
rev4-6326414672012357313-00044 it should sell in the region of 450
rev4-6326414672012357313-00046 if you were to build
rev4-6326414672012357313-00047 so even if there was a collapse situation
rev4-6326414672012357313-00049 how are they going to get on
rev4-6326414672012357313-00051 there is the development potential on the plot
rev4-6326414672012357313-00052 on the negative side
rev4-6326414672012357313-00053 a normal rabbit
rev4-6326414672012357313-00056 other than that
rev4-6326414672012357313-00058 it's really nice
rev4-6326414672012357313-00060 you never know quite what to bid to
rev4-6326414672012357313-00061 but now that the work's been done
rev4-6326414672012357313-00062 about three and a half miles from the nearest town of belper
rev4-6326414672012357313-00064 and before that
rev4-6326414672012357313-00066 and i think for that 80
rev4-6326414672012357313-00069 it won't appeal to everybody
rev4-6326414672012357313-00072 so not a good start
rev4-6326414672012357313-00073 so move into while i'm doing the work
rev4-6326414672012357313-00074 nice windows with a view out the front
rev4-6326414672012357313-00075 cos i'm home based
rev4-6326414672012357313-00080 you can find out later in the show
rev4-6326414672012357313-00083 did today's buyers finish their projects or was time their enemy
rev4-6326414672012357313-00085 we would look to market the property at an asking price in the region of 385
rev4-6326414672012357313-00086 it was a bit tired
rev4-6326414672012357313-00087 i think it's beautifully presented
rev4-6326414672012357313-00089 000 mark with a view to returning about 160
rev4-6326461057659161695-00005 but this family are spending so much
rev4-6326461057659161695-00008 she knows that she can't get to the paralympics
rev4-6326461057659161695-00009 train like that
rev4-6326461057659161695-00010 and eat stuff out of pots that you pour boiling water over
rev4-6326461057659161695-00011 thank you very much
rev4-6326461057659161695-00013 that tastes really clean and fresh
rev4-6326461057659161695-00015 after five years
rev4-6326461057659161695-00016 being catered for
rev4-6326461057659161695-00018 we set you a target of 3
rev4-6326461057659161695-00019 big fan of the brands and convenience food
rev4-6326538367070482119-00001 are we being duped
rev4-6326538367070482119-00002 until about three on one occasion
rev4-6326538367070482119-00004 and it is enormous
rev4-6326553828952690654-00001 i have long been an earnest advocate of closer ties between our two countries
rev4-6326553828952690654-00002 we will receive on united states soil
rev4-6326553828952690654-00003 we should pursue this strategy
rev4-6326553828952690654-00006 if entrusted to our navies
rev4-6326553828952690654-00007 as much information as your acts would allow us to have in advance of you getting the weapon into
rev4-6326553828952690654-00011 they don't want it
rev4-6326553828952690654-00012 the police tactics
rev4-6326553828952690654-00015 into one particular programme
rev4-6326553828952690654-00016 which is always dangerous for any politician
rev4-6326553828952690654-00017 5 billion into it already
rev4-6326553828952690654-00018 what is really meant by the words
rev4-6326553828952690654-00020 the uk wants a nuclear force
rev4-6326553828952690654-00023 if you're not prepared to provide us with polaris
rev4-6326866932068565154-00001 life expectancy could be as low as 40 years
rev4-6326866932068565154-00002 original ideas and i'm sorry
rev4-6326866932068565154-00005 they should be able to rise to the challenge and show us they can work with a raw material and make
rev4-6326866932068565154-00008 and men were encouraged to keep fit
rev4-6326866932068565154-00012 because this is all about being eclectic
rev4-6326866932068565154-00015 if a homeowner asks for contemporary
rev4-6326866932068565154-00016 i want to see that she can deliver that
rev4-6326990627126693682-00003 what we're looking for is whipped
rev4-6326990627126693682-00004 and that's part of the problem
rev4-6326990627126693682-00005 when it is simple
rev4-6326990627126693682-00006 i'm a pretty skilled baker
rev4-6327199362537275576-00005 and lighting your way to the future
rev4-6327199362537275576-00007 i'm happy to say
rev4-6327199362537275576-00008 but your candlestick was an enormous success
rev4-6327199362537275576-00017 but you were right to call me
rev4-6327295999301439627-00001 95 of people do
rev4-6327295999301439627-00005 if you don't do it
rev4-6327295999301439627-00009 you've got that wonderful sage
rev4-6327295999301439627-00011 it's not somewhere out of harry potter
rev4-6327295999301439627-00012 it's just up the road from kingy's house
rev4-6327295999301439627-00014 and a visit is well worth it
rev4-6327295999301439627-00018 like a language
rev4-6327295999301499598-00001 i wouldn't recommend jumping out of a cake
rev4-6327295999301499598-00003 my day already feels rather overwhelming
rev4-6327295999301499598-00004 in times of great stress and confusion
rev4-6327295999301499598-00005 i'd say there ought to be less of it
rev4-6327295999301499598-00007 for your information
rev4-6327295999301499598-00008 probably best take care of yourself
rev4-6327295999301499598-00010 a splenic artery aneurysm repair
rev4-6327570447711650000-00004 have you no feelings
rev4-6327570447711650000-00005 you've been robbed
rev4-6327609102417316299-00002 it existed in a time warp
rev4-6327609102417316299-00004 take all the nutrients and energy back into the soil where it can be used by the plants again to
rev4-6327609102417316299-00006 all these plants would die
rev4-6327609102417316299-00010 maybe some disturbed vegetation
rev4-6327609102417316299-00011 thick bamboo breaks
rev4-6327609102417316299-00012 it's really hard to stay quiet around here
rev4-6327713470253076639-00001 then they can be re buried with all the dignity they deserve
rev4-6327713470253076639-00002 we would probably have a different national identity
rev4-6327713470253076639-00004 and if they do turn out to be those of alfred
rev4-6327713470253076639-00007 but that was only the start of the story
rev4-6327713470253076639-00009 so in honour of his father
rev4-6327713470253076639-00011 just four years after his burial
rev4-6327713470253076639-00012 by the 9th century
rev4-6327713470253076639-00016 but they were soon enthusiastic about making pilgrimages to rome
rev4-6327713470253076639-00017 alfred's father was no exception and he sent young alfred on two visits to the city
rev4-6327713470253076639-00018 the first in 853 when the boy was just four years old
rev4-6327713470253076639-00019 these visits to the most impressive and powerful city in the western world made a huge impression
rev4-6327713470253076639-00020 and over time it became a permanent saxon base
rev4-6327713470253076639-00021 praying for the protection of the city as he did so
rev4-6327713470253076639-00022 it shaped his thinking as an adult
rev4-6327713470253076639-00023 because he was to grow into a committed
rev4-6327713470253076639-00024 this may have been a special ceremony to honour a son of the royal house of wessex
rev4-6327713470253076639-00025 whatever it really meant
rev4-6327713470253076639-00026 that dominated the landscape
rev4-6327713470253076639-00027 carrying the remains of king alfred
rev4-6327713470253076639-00028 her mother was a member of the mercian royal family
rev4-6327713470253076639-00029 causes severe stomach pain
rev4-6327713470253076639-00030 experts have suggested that the ailment that stuck him down
rev4-6327713470253076639-00031 and affected him for years to come
rev4-6327713470253076639-00032 guthrum and his men mounted a surprise attack
rev4-6327713470253076639-00033 alfred had fought alongside his brothers so he was no stranger to the battlefield
rev4-6327713470253076639-00038 eventually becoming lord chancellor himself
rev4-6327713470253076639-00039 and he made his name helping henry resolve one of the greatest crises of his reign
rev4-6327713470253076639-00040 and all the while
rev4-6327713470253076639-00042 but they're made even more so when you realise that all of this was put in place as part of a
rev4-6327713470253076639-00048 he was also careful to keep half the men in reserve
rev4-6327713470253076639-00049 grimbald from france and
rev4-6327713470253076639-00050 according to howard
rev4-6327713470253076639-00051 the keeper of the jail was a man by the name of mr page
rev4-6327713470253076639-00052 and mr page told him that in advance of the building work
rev4-6327713470253076639-00053 that's 38 in today's money
rev4-6327713470253076639-00054 the reverend william williams
rev4-6327713470253076639-00055 because we only have that one piece
rev4-6327713470253076639-00058 to do further excavation on this site to see what else is turned up
rev4-6327713470253076639-00062 but it's another very important step
rev4-6327740528416575363-00001 all doing it for a living
rev4-6327740528416575363-00003 because they are next
rev4-6327740528416575363-00004 and that's how they do it
rev4-6327740528416575363-00005 that kind of entices the general managers into thinking
rev4-6327740528416575363-00006 wages and salaries are about 900 billion
rev4-6327740528416575363-00007 although four billion sounds a huge amount of money
rev4-6327740528416575363-00008 it comes either from the owners of companies
rev4-6327740528416575363-00009 the negative effect is that people might in the end find getting jobs much more difficult
rev4-6327740528416575363-00010 not because they're thrown out of work because of the minimum wage
rev4-6327740528416575363-00011 with clean sheets
rev4-6327740528416575363-00012 is part and parcel of working in housekeeping
rev4-6327740528416575363-00013 let me finish now
rev4-6327740528416575363-00015 this is getting your rejects
rev4-6327740528416575363-00017 we want to work
rev4-6327740528416575363-00019 and in this hotel
rev4-6327740528416575363-00020 if i'm being honest
rev4-6327740528416575363-00021 and i don't think we should have to live like that
rev4-6327740528416575363-00022 not when he works so hard
rev4-6327740528416575363-00023 i think i'm a lot bigger in personality
rev4-6327740528416575363-00024 do you think in certain sectors it keeps the wages down because migrants are prepared to work for
rev4-6327740528416575363-00025 they do say that migration has kept a downward pressure on wages in
rev4-6327740528416575363-00026 who may think that those jobs aren't the kind of jobs they want to do
rev4-6327740528416575363-00027 but i think that rather than think
rev4-6327740528416575363-00028 the problem is migration and therefore we should stop that
rev4-6327740528416575363-00036 because people come here
rev4-6327740528416575363-00037 they want to work
rev4-6327740528416575363-00038 they will then pay taxes
rev4-6327740528416575363-00039 i used to have people for dinner once a week
rev4-6327941532886024424-00001 the safer society will be
rev4-6327941532886024424-00002 full of contrition
rev4-6327941532886024424-00006 you realise what this means
rev4-6327980187591690710-00003 that will be really helpful
rev4-6328038169780654524-00001 many of them left from here in southampton
rev4-6328038169780654524-00003 the valentines' six cylinder diesel engines roared into life
rev4-6328038169780654524-00004 with the canvas screens providing little
rev4-6328038169780654524-00005 protection from the incoming waves
rev4-6328038169780654524-00008 what it would have been like for someone like frank
rev4-6328038169780654524-00009 eight ounces of gunpowder
rev4-6328038169780654524-00010 brown paper bag
rev4-6328038169780654524-00012 small explosives could be detonated to break off the tail section
rev4-6328038169780654524-00013 technology was the silent ally
rev4-6328038169780654524-00014 it paved the way for men to fight on the beaches of normandy
rev4-6328111613590949805-00003 who is an expert in york
rev4-6328111613590949805-00004 it says it there
rev4-6328111613590949805-00006 someone called wimpy klop
rev4-6328111613590949805-00009 can we get the owners to agree
rev4-6328111613590949805-00010 so after the second world war
rev4-6328111613590949805-00012 and get the money
rev4-6328111613590949805-00013 we call him the old general
rev4-6328111613590949805-00015 he was staying with them
rev4-6328111613590949805-00016 normally what we would do is we would package up this information and we would present it to a
rev4-6328111613590949805-00017 in this litigious environment in the united states
rev4-6328111613590949805-00018 what worries people is being sued
rev4-6328111613590949805-00019 and what difference would it make to you if we could prove it
rev4-6328111613590949805-00021 so quite a long time ago
rev4-6328111613590949805-00023 it's always going to raise questions
rev4-6328111613590949805-00024 it's from bruce kaiser
rev4-6328111613590949805-00025 i would guess the probability of this occurring randomly approaches the same probability of someone
rev4-6328111613590949805-00026 using the same paint in exactly the same way
rev4-6328111613590949805-00027 if we can do that
rev4-6328111613590949805-00029 the sad fact is you may not own this picture
rev4-6328111613590949805-00030 because even if there is confusion about the ownership
rev4-6328312618060398848-00009 thank you for supporting my malvolio
rev4-6328312618060398848-00010 photography is very much part of show business
rev4-6328312618060398848-00011 if the royal shakespeare company give me suitable parts
rev4-6328351272766065122-00002 especially mammal life
rev4-6328351272766065122-00003 but working as a team
rev4-6328351272766065122-00006 why is it so valuable
rev4-6328351272766065122-00007 when the scales became in great demand for asian wildlife trade
rev4-6328393792942295524-00001 spend some time making sure we get it exactly right
rev4-6328393792942295524-00002 it's much better because you don't create landfill and you're reusing what you've got about
rev4-6328393792942295524-00003 it's five to one
rev4-6328393792942295524-00004 which means it's five sand to one cement
rev4-6328393792942295524-00005 so there doesn't need to be a layer of hardcore beneath the cement and brick
rev4-6328393792942295524-00006 and my grandma and my grandad
rev4-6328393792942295524-00010 and birds actually like to be able to hop in and look around in a hedge
rev4-6328512334039666732-00003 is it possible to do that
rev4-6328512334039666732-00005 it's got to be the sugar in combination with other things
rev4-6328512334039666732-00007 when we are exposed to different things
rev4-6328512334039666732-00008 judging from today
rev4-6328512334039666732-00010 as ruth goodman's been learning
rev4-6328512334039666732-00012 stop consuming it
rev4-6328512334039666732-00013 with the entire industry based upon slavery
rev4-6328656644940810739-00006 they can come here and spend some time relaxing
rev4-6328656644940810739-00011 i'd rather be in josh's spot
rev4-6328764878116731644-00002 this is the show where all the questions have been asked to 100 people before the show
rev4-6328764878116731644-00003 and all our celebrities have to do is come up with the answers that none of those 100 people could
rev4-6328764878116731644-00005 each of our celebrities is playing for a nominated charity
rev4-6328764878116731644-00007 we just had a ball
rev4-6328764878116731644-00008 let's just talk about m people
rev4-6328764878116731644-00010 a lot of people
rev4-6328764878116731644-00013 let's change and get back to gardening as well
rev4-6328764878116731644-00014 who was your drummer
rev4-6328764878116731644-00019 six on the second
rev4-6328764878116731644-00021 let's play our five little tracks and here they are
rev4-6328764878116731644-00022 and it's a multisensory centre for people with special needs
rev4-6328764878116731644-00023 which is the twins and multiple births association and they actually helped me and gave me lots of
rev4-6328764878116731644-00025 if it's right and it's pointless
rev4-6328764878116731644-00028 this has to be pointless for you to win that jackpot
rev4-6328764878116731644-00029 as today's show is a celebrity special
rev4-6328764878116731644-00030 join us next time
rev4-6328764878116731644-00031 when we'll be putting more obscure knowledge to the test on pointless
rev4-6328764878116731644-00032 and playing us out with moving on up
rev4-6328962017115556355-00001 so that's a very healthy young plant
rev4-6328962017115556355-00002 instead of being opposite one another
rev4-6328962017115556355-00003 we're used to crab apples being big fruit
rev4-6328962017115556355-00004 which are about three or four years older
rev4-6328962017115556355-00007 some of my favourite fruits
rev4-6328962017115556355-00009 they store the damp
rev4-6328962017115556355-00010 i just keep trying different stuff and the stuff that works and looks right
rev4-6328962017115556355-00011 because that's it
rev4-6329054788409218032-00003 ten favourite dishes that i cook
rev4-6329054788409218032-00004 i don't fancy that
rev4-6329054788409218032-00008 so i hope that he does like it
rev4-6329054788409218032-00016 they did amazingly well
rev4-6329054788409218032-00017 they're eating healthier
rev4-6329062519350282760-00002 because using vegetables in a dessert has become more popular nowadays
rev4-6329062519350282760-00006 but anything can happen with dessert
rev4-6329062519350282760-00008 he's got 15 minutes left to go
rev4-6329062519350282760-00009 his ice cream is not even in the machine
rev4-6329062519350282760-00011 regardless of their background
rev4-6329062519350282760-00013 right hand out to shake
rev4-6329062519350282760-00014 and then step back
rev4-6329062519350282760-00016 through to the judges
rev4-6329062519350282760-00017 i didn't want to be going home on thursday
rev4-6329151425173313518-00001 i know i don't sound it
rev4-6329151425173313518-00002 but i'm a scot by birth
rev4-6329151425173313518-00003 for what it's worth
rev4-6329151425173313518-00004 it was rather male
rev4-6329151425173313518-00005 it felt slightly dark
rev4-6329151425173313518-00006 it was fiercely pro british unionist and it was mildly conservative
rev4-6329151425173313518-00007 in every possible cultural way
rev4-6329151425173313518-00010 where women seem to be running almost everything and which is
rev4-6329151425173313518-00011 so the question is very straightforward and simple to pose
rev4-6329151425173313518-00013 the scottish conservative and unionist party
rev4-6329151425173313518-00015 an achievement that would stand for half a century to come
rev4-6329151425173313518-00016 the tories then could have called themselves the party of scotland
rev4-6329151425173313518-00017 back in the day
rev4-6329151425173313518-00018 there were lots of small businesses
rev4-6329151425173313518-00023 and all these industries
rev4-6329151425173313518-00024 which had a great past
rev4-6329151425173313518-00025 the tories got the blame for that
rev4-6329151425173313518-00026 you also became
rev4-6329151425173313518-00029 and they were immensely proud of the ships they sent down the clyde
rev4-6329151425173313518-00030 many of them royal naval ships
rev4-6329151425173313518-00031 and if you weren't labour
rev4-6329151425173313518-00033 the women in the scheme in old monkland
rev4-6329151425173313518-00034 that i was born and brought up in
rev4-6329151425173313518-00035 they were at the doors because this was a girl from coatbridge going to the uni
rev4-6329151425173313518-00036 the end of heavy industry on the clyde and so forth
rev4-6329151425173313518-00037 people had to move away
rev4-6329151425173313518-00039 what scotland now is
rev4-6329151425173313518-00040 produces a post industrial politics
rev4-6329151425173313518-00041 what does that mean
rev4-6329151425173313518-00042 going to this school
rev4-6329151425173313518-00043 therefore i vote for that party
rev4-6329151425173313518-00044 which gave them power at the heart of the labour party and therefore at westminster
rev4-6329151425173313518-00046 she was an attractive woman
rev4-6329151425173313518-00047 could sustain itself
rev4-6329151425173313518-00049 ladies and gentlemen
rev4-6329151425173313518-00051 i stand before you
rev4-6329151425173313518-00054 and if you wish it
rev4-6329151425173313518-00055 even in the 1979 general election
rev4-6329151425173313518-00056 margaret thatcher's great triumph
rev4-6329151425173313518-00057 labour in scotland had a clear majority
rev4-6329151425173313518-00058 44 out of 71 of the available seats
rev4-6329151425173313518-00061 you something something lunatic
rev4-6329151425173313518-00062 if they push on with the unacceptable proposals of recent years
rev4-6329151425173313518-00064 it looks from the latest figures
rev4-6329151425173313518-00066 then basically what was left tended to be non catholic
rev4-6329151425173313518-00067 who set up the adam smith institute subsequently
rev4-6329151425173313518-00068 even more important
rev4-6329151425173313518-00071 when the big state was at its biggest
rev4-6329151425173313518-00072 just two years before she was forced from power
rev4-6329151425173313518-00074 perhaps it would be best
rev4-6329151425173313518-00075 but first they had to believe in wealth creation
rev4-6329151425173313518-00076 otherwise where did the money come from
rev4-6329151425173313518-00077 and they had to believe in original sin
rev4-6329151425173313518-00078 and that they should look after their own families first and they should not depend on high
rev4-6329151425173313518-00079 scots had had enough of what they regarded as margaret thatcher's grating
rev4-6329151425173313518-00080 that perfectly manicured fingernail jabbing at them
rev4-6329151425173313518-00081 the churchmen made it clear they were distinctly unamused
rev4-6329151425173313518-00082 they spoke for many scots
rev4-6329151425173313518-00085 but they're predictable conservative attacks
rev4-6329151425173313518-00086 the randomness of human life is very
rev4-6329151425173313518-00087 we would not have lived through new labour
rev4-6329151425173313518-00088 more than 22 years on
rev4-6329151425173313518-00090 the tories would have been different
rev4-6329151425173313518-00092 over domestic affairs
rev4-6329151425173313518-00093 in the 1970s had been a dominant issue in the politics of the labour government at that time
rev4-6329151425173313518-00095 part of every one of us
rev4-6329151425173313518-00096 and we respect it
rev4-6329151425173313518-00098 if there are any
rev4-6329151425173313518-00099 but especially in the local areas
rev4-6329151425173313518-00100 that didn't mean it wasn't successful in scotland
rev4-6329151425173313518-00101 while you had much
rev4-6329151425173313518-00102 much disillusionment with the labour party in scotland
rev4-6329151425173313518-00103 and i think that is
rev4-6329151425173313518-00104 a combination of that
rev4-6329151425173313518-00105 because people in scotland wanted a parliament
rev4-6329151425173313518-00107 because people wanted
rev4-6329151425173313518-00108 scotland wanted a scottish parliament and therefore
rev4-6329151425173313518-00111 where people want a greater sense of identity
rev4-6329151425173313518-00112 look for identity
rev4-6329151425173313518-00113 where identity politics is much more important
rev4-6329151425173313518-00114 whether it's uk and brussels
rev4-6329151425173313518-00115 or whether it's
rev4-6329151425173313518-00116 legal and decisive
rev4-6329151425173313518-00117 in the coming days
rev4-6329151425173313518-00118 and i think then we need to move forward and say
rev4-6329151425173313518-00119 if there are problems of uncertainty and lack of clarity
rev4-6329151425173313518-00120 and i don't think we should just let this go on year after year
rev4-6329835613463566698-00001 tell me what would you do
rev4-6329835613463566698-00002 would you buy this
rev4-6329835613463566698-00005 this is quite a bold project and yet you don't seem remotely fazed by any of it
rev4-6329835613463566698-00007 maybe that's incredibly naive of me but i just think it will be ok and it will all work out
rev4-6329835613463566698-00011 imagine the kind of farmer who has leisure time
rev4-6329835613463566698-00014 in the section about the dudleston farms
rev4-6329835613463566698-00015 once we get over these issues
rev4-6329835613463566698-00017 these actually carry the sashes and the weights in here
rev4-6329835613463566698-00018 we can't finish our structural phase of our mortgage
rev4-6329835613463566698-00020 which we don't need
rev4-6329835613463566698-00021 she wants them to read
rev4-6329835613463566698-00022 at the end of the day
rev4-6329835613463566698-00023 we can say it wasn't in budget but it needs to be done
rev4-6329835613463566698-00024 it's got a missing tooth
rev4-6329835613463566698-00025 he also founded the local grammar school
rev4-6329835613463566698-00026 the grant was obtained under which was founded the royal free grammar school of shrewsbury
rev4-6329835613463566698-00027 who is that person
rev4-6329893595522062514-00003 me and my best mate
rev4-6329893595522062514-00004 not for any other reason
rev4-6329893595522062514-00005 i'm not doing it
rev4-6329893595522062514-00006 i'm not flaming going in the transport that he's organised
rev4-6329893595522062514-00007 what is the plural for mecca
rev4-6329893595522062514-00009 at the same level of their profession
rev4-6329893595522062514-00010 three michelin stars
rev4-6329893595522122781-00002 it's all been fairly recent
rev4-6329893595522122781-00005 it's not diabetes
rev4-6329893595522122781-00006 it's not an infection
rev4-6329893595522122781-00007 it's not a stroke
rev4-6329893595522122781-00008 i feel like we're running out of time
rev4-6329893595522122781-00010 normal antibody levels
rev4-6329893595522122781-00011 similar partial paralysis
